= FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
= NO-COST RHEL DEVELOPER SUITE SUBSCRIPTION

== General

. *What is being made available at no cost?*
+
Developers can now get a no-cost subscription for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Suite by joining the Red Hat Developer Program at link:#{site.base_url}[developers.redhat.com].

. *What's included in the no-cost Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Suite?*
+
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Suite includes:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server.
* Red Hat Software Collections.
* Red Hat Developer Toolset.
* numerous Red Hat Enterprise Linux infrastructure add-ons.

. *Is the Red Hat Enterprise Linux in this subscription the same as what enterprises use in production?*
+
Yes, the bits are identical to enable you to develop and test your software on the same platform as production users. In addition to the current release, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, you will also have access to all of the currently supported releases including 5 and 6, enabling you to build and test for older/legacy systems covering a ten year lifespan.

. *What's different between this no-cost Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription and one used by enterprises in production?*
+
All of the software binaries that are available to a subscription are the same regardless of the support level. Subscriptions vary by the level and type of support offered. Enterprises purchase subscriptions that include service level agreements that meet their business' need for response times. The no-cost developer suite subscription is self-supported. Your subscription gives you access to the Red Hat Customer Portal, link:https://access.redhat.com[access.redhat.com]. Subscriber-only content on the portal includes a knowledgebase with thousands of articles that cover configuration, deployment, troubleshooting, and security.
+
Finally, the biggest difference is that the no-cost Developer Suite subscription is only for development purposes and may not be used in production. So, while the bits are the same, the differences are the terms of use and the support level. The no-cost Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Suite is for development purposes only and is self-supported. For production and other uses not covered by the developer agreement, Red Hat offers subscriptions with a choice of support coverage (typical business day only, 24 x 7, etc.) and response time agreements.

. *What is self-support and what does this no-cost Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Suite subscription cover?*
+
The no-cost Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Suite subscription is for link:#{site.base_url}/terms-and-conditions/[development use only]. The support is self service through the Red Hat Customer Portal, link:https://access.redhat.com[access.redhat.com]. Your self-support subscription includes:

* An entitlement to register the system running Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
* Complete access to Red Hat Enterprise Linux updates and errata.
* Access to knowledgebase articles, portal discussion groups, and magazines on the link:https://access.redhat.com[Red Hat Customer Portal].
* Users can open a support ticket for issues related to Red Hat Network registration or issues related to `yum` updates.
* This subscription does not include support on any operating system related issue. Users may look for the resolution in our knowledgebase articles or can discuss it over portal groups with respective domain experts. Note: there is no service level agreement for discussing issues over portal groups.

. *Is this no-cost subscription for individuals or businesses/enterprises*?
+
The no-cost self-supported subscriptions are best suited for individual/personal accounts because only one no-cost subscription may be added to an account. These subscriptions are ideal for an individual developer who wants to develop on Red Hat Enterprise Linux using their personal system.

. *Can I use this no-cost subscription on a corporate-owned device?*
+
You may use this subscription on corporate-owned devices. However, you should check to make sure that doing so doesn't violate your organization's IT policies. The no-cost subscription is assigned to the individual that creates the account, The account used to obtain the no-cost subscription will be completely separate from any existing corporate accounts. Your organization's group that handles procurement will not be able to track or manage subscriptions obtained individually through the developer program. Many organizations prohibit installing software that isn't licensed to the organization.

. *How many Red Hat Enterprise Linux entitlements are included?*
+
You may use this no-cost Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription on one (1) physical system with up to eight processor sockets. If you are using a system with virtualization, you can installed an unlimited number of guest virtual machines (VMs) on that system.
+
For example:

* If your development system is running Windows, you can create as many Red Hat Enterprise Linux VMs as you need on your Windows system using VirtualBox, VMware, or Microsoft Hyper-V.
* If you install Red Hat Enterprise Linux on a physical system, you may create an unlimited number of guests VM on that t system using KVM/libvirt virtualization or other hypervisor.

. *Can I add additional no-cost Developer Suite subscriptions to my account to cover other systems or developers?*
+
Only one no-cost Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Suite subscription can be added to an account. Other developers can create their own accounts at link:#{site.base_url}/[developers.redhat.com].
+
Organizations with multiple developers may want to look into link:https://www.redhat.com/apps/store/developers/[purchasing development subscription packs] that include developer support and allow multiple systems to be managed from a single account.

. *Can I get no-cost Developer Suite subscriptions for my whole team?*
+
Only one no-cost Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Suite subscription can be added to an account. While it is possible to have each developer register for their own account, this is not ideal from a management or efficiency standpoint. For example, if a company wanted no-cost Developer Suite subscriptions to cover 100 developers, each developer would need to individually register, creating 100 accounts that need to be tracked and maintained. For enterprises that use Red Hat Satellite to manage multiple system, all 100 accounts would need to be added individually. Accepting the terms and conditions and renewing the subscription annually would need to be done individually and manually for all 100 accounts. Staff turn over in the development team would create additional management challenges with individual accounts. Therefore in terms of lost productivity, managing individual no-cost subscriptions will not be cost-effective for many groups.
+
Many development organizations benefit from having Red Hat Developer Support. Cost effective bundles are available that include support with a pack of 25 Developer Suite subscriptions that can be managed from a single account.

. *Since this is a subscription, do I have to renew? What is the term length for this? How do I renew?*
+
Like the fee-based version, this is a 12-month subscription. Renewal is simple and only requires that you agree to the then-current version of the T&Cs. You can view information about your subscription including the expiration date at link:https://access.redhat.com/management/[access.redhat.com/management].

. *Can I use this subscription for testing as well as development?*
+
The no-cost Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Suite may be used for development and single-user testing per link:http://www.redhat.com/licenses/GLOBAL_Appendix_one_English_20160111.pdf[Appendix 1] of the the Red Hat subscription agreement.

. *Does my existing Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription (not the no-cost development version) include access to Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) or Developer Toolset (DTS)?*
+
For the majority of Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions, yes. See link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/472793[How to use Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) or Red Hat Developer Toolset (DTS)] for a detailed list.

. *Are subscriptions tied to a specific release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux?*
+
No. A subscription can be used for any of the currently supported versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Major releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux are supported for ten years. After ten years, extended support is available, which requires a different type of subscription.
+
Note that subscriptions are for a specific variant, such as desktop, workstation, or server. The no-cost subscription is for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server, which is a super set of the other editions. 

. *Can I use this no-cost subscription for Red Hat Enterprises Linux 6 or other releases?*
+
Yes. In addition to the current release, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, you will also have access to all of the currently supported releases including 5 and 6. Currently, only the most recent release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux is available from link:#{site.base_url}/[developers.redhat.com].
