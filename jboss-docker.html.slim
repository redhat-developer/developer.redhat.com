    | The
    a(href="http://www.docker.com/")  Docker project
    |  revolutionizes thinking about software delivery making it easy to build and share images that include your content. We love the idea behind Docker and ship images for our projects. Just for you.
    br
    | Pssst. If youâ€™re new to Docker please take 8 minutes to
    a(href="http://www.docker.com/whatisdocker/")  watch this introduction to Docker.
    |  And of course
    a(href="http://www.docker.com/tryit/")  give it a try!

    h3 Goal
    p 
      | We provide Docker images for our
      a(href="#{site.base_url}/projects")  upstream community projects
      |  to let you focus on using them instead of worrying about packaging. The Docker image delivery format makes it easy to extend/reuse images. It is a good idea to use our images as the base for your own image (using the 
      code FROM
      |  command in your
      a(href="http://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/")  Dockerfile.
    h3 Documentation
    p Every image is different therefore please consult the readme linked to each image. If you donâ€™t find the answer there, donâ€™t hesitate to contact us.

      a(href="https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles")  GitHub organization.
    h3 Contact
    p 
      | Weâ€™re there for you on IRC in the 
      code #jboss-docker
      |  channel on Freenode.

      | We publish our images under the official
      a(href="https://hub.docker.com/u/jboss/")  jboss organization.
      |  Every image is built from Dockerfiles available from the repositories in our
      a(href="https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles")  GitHub organization.
      |  Images are linked to each other: If an image we're base on is modified, we rebuild our image to provide you the fresh image that you deserve.
