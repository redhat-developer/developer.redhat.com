    url: http://developers.redhat.com/video/youtube/I-Po2phF-_M
    description: 'In 2003 the Java EE ecosystem received a gift with extensions: JCA 1.5 support in J2EE 1.4. However, it wasn’t until Java EE 5, in 2006, that extensions were really talked about. In Java EE 5, we received Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI). Along with the namesake of the specification, extensions were introduced. Together we have the ability to extend the platform to do whatever we need. The possibilities of these extensions are limited only by your imagination. You’ve heard about CDI and the extensibility of Java EE 6 and seen enough to pique your curiosity. This session will sate that curiosity and give you enough information to build great extensions for your application and business.'

    description: 'The Borg is docking your system; testing is futile! Or is it? With microservices, polyglot, and DevOps on the rise, where are we at with testing? Do these technologies bring more complexity and make our testing effort harder, or maybe the contrary? Do they actually help us write better tests more easily? This session explores not only how we can do our testing in this new world but also how the new world can help us test better. It takes a close look at various topics, from NodeJS-, DynJS-, VertX-, Ceylon-, or Ruby-orchestrated microservices through system-scale testing with various configurations to database migration and regression testing. All are within reach.'

    description: 'Modern machines have more memory and more processors than ever. Service-level agreement (SLA) applications guarantee response times of 10 to 500 milliseconds. To meet the lower end of that goal, we need garbage collection algorithms that are efficient enough to enable programs to run in the available memory but also optimized to never interrupt the running program for more than a handful of milliseconds. Shenandoah is an open source low-pause-time collector for OpenJDK designed to meet those goals. Learn more in this session.'

This session shows the features that make many developers love Lucene, with some concrete examples of common problems it elegantly solves. You’ll see some best practices for using it in a Java EE stack and how some popular OSS projects such as Hibernate ORM (JPA provider), WildFly (Java EE runtime), and Infinispan (in-memory data grid, JCache implementer) actually provide great Lucene integration capabilities and how they can help resolve some modern challenges such as deployment in the cloud.'

WildFly Swarm comes to the rescue, allowing flexibility in how a Java EE application is packaged. If your company has experience with Java EE and you’ve been thinking about getting into microservices, or even just single-purpose deployments, that doesn’t have to mean ditching Java EE. The presentation shows how WildFly Swarm can construct a single JAR containing a Java EE application, along with whatever WildFly components it would require, that can be deployed easily and quickly to any environment with a JVM.'

However, security and cryptography, at some level, are easy to get wrong. Most of the time, we don’t care which algorithms—SHA-256 or SHA-512, RSA or ECC, AES-128 or AES-256, padding schemes, iteration number, key sizes—are ideal for encryption or if a poor choice could benefit attackers. Developers need to keep an eye on so many problems that with just a single wrong line of code, they can potentially introduce a new weakness. Learn more in this session.'

While doing this, you realized that you can no longer rely on your application server to handle all the authentication. Oh, and of course, one of your teams used Node.js. How are you going to secure all the endpoints so that end users don’t have to authenticate against each one. This session demonstrates use of a centralized authentication service to secure many different microservice architectures. The demos focus on the Keycloak project but apply just as much to Stormpath, Ping Identity, and similar services.'

    description: 'When work on CDI started, in 2006, the goal was only to provide an utility API to ease integration of the service tier (EJB) and the presentation layer (JSF) in the Java EE platform. It became far more than that. Today CDI is a complete dependency injection framework supporting contexts from the UI to the back end and providing an event bus, an AOP framework, and a powerful SPI for creating extensions. The goal of this session is to show the main patterns currently offered by CDI and to present the work of the expert group on the upcoming CDI 2.0. It is also to call for ideas from the community: what would you want to see introduced in CDI 2.0? There’s still time to share your request with the expert group or bring your contribution.'

Frameworks such as Rails have grown up with the modern web, now supporting WebSockets, microservices, and integration with JavaScript client libraries such as Ember. Concurrency utilities modeled after the JDK are helping Ruby scale horizontally. Applications can be built with Rake—or with JRuby plugins for Gradle and Maven. Maven poms can be written in a beautiful Ruby DSL. Swing, JavaFX, and other graphics libraries become easy and fun with JRuby. Sass and Asciidoctor are already being used in Java apps, thanks to JRuby. And you can bundle up the whole thing in an executable JAR or WAR file; your DevOps will never know it’s Ruby. Come to this session to see what JRuby 9000 can do for you in 2015.'

It discusses: understanding where a Java EE programming model can help you build a decoupled codebase, how we can leverage CDI extensions (through JMS and proxies) to deploy Java EE components as microservices, how to deploy Java EE components into a cloud-enabled microservices setup. Attendees can expect to see a running demo of a Java EE application deployed as microservices units in the cloud.'

How to get the most out of it with Java EE and WildFly is exactly the topic of this session. It introduces you to both Java EE 7 and Apache Camel in a very brief way, follows up with various integration and deployment scenarios, and introduces the tools that can help you the most on the way to your integration solution.'
