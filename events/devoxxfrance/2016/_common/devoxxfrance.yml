    date: 'Friday at 14:55 - 15:40'
    abstract: "With microservices, polyglot and DevOps on the rise, where are we at with testing? Does it bring more complexity and make our testing effort harder or maybe in contrary; it actually helps us write better tests easier?<br>In this session, we will be exploring not only how we can do our testing in this new world, but also how the new world can help us test better. Meet Arquillian Cube and Q. We will take a close look at topics varying from polyglot services, orchestrated microservices to system scale testing. All are within reach. And with full control; Let's add a dash of chaos!"

    abstract: "Vert.x 3 is a library to build responsive applications running on a Java virtual machine. Vert.x 3 offers a very good level of performance and a small and simple API. With vert.x 3 you can develop applications \"micro-services\" distributed not only in Java, but also JavaScript, Groovy, Ruby and Ceylon. Vert.x 3 also allows integrating applications non-vert.x as node.js, .NET or C. This workshop offers an introduction to application development \"micro-services\" with vert.x. You will develop a multilingual application (using different programming languages) deployed in a set of interconnected containers docker."

    abstract: "ElasticSearch is the search engine, highly scalable and easy to deploy. One of the challenges is to keep the data source (RDBMS) and the index ElasticSearch always synchronized.<br>Hibernate ORM is the perfect tool to persist in the database.<br>It would be nice if Hiberrnate ORM could automatically push all changes to ElasticSearch. It would be nice if ElasticSearch requests brought back objects of the business model as a HQL query does.<br>Among the latest development of Hibernate Search , discover through practice how ElasticSearch universe and Hibernate meet."

Well, no! Thou art rather an encoder, so have fun together to build an app and explore the possibilities SDK WatchOS2 with some live coding. We begin with a short description of how to define a UI in a Storyboard (the visual representation of the user interface in Xcode): simplified layout watchOS, notifications vs. glances and complications (which are not as complicated as it ).We look shows how your interact with your iPhone. And finally, of course we will explore the HealthKit to measure your heartbeat."

Worse, it is often neglected, poorly implemented and intrusive in the code.But lately, one sees security servers which allow to outsource and delegate all authentication and authorization aspects, such https://auth0.com/. Of these servers, one of the most promising is Keycloak, open-source, flexible and agnostic of any technology, it is easily deployable / adaptable in its own infrastructure.<br>In this session, I propose you to discover gradually Keycloak and interactive: 0 slide, 100% live coding. Java EE app a \"classic\" in particular we will see how to secure a Microservice Node.js, a standalone Web App Angular or even a mobile application.OAuth2 be explained in a simple and concrete way, we will introduce the social login, SSO (Single Sign On) and will also discuss how to connect to an existing secure system: SAML, LDAP ..."
