// Microsite title
### Microservices for Java Developers: A Hands-On Introduction to Frameworks and Containers.

// Microsite subtitle
#### The Microservice architectural approach is more than just about technology. It reaches into the foundation of your organization to allow you to build truly scalable, adaptive, complex systems that help a business adapt to rapidly changing competitive markets.

*Using a hands-on approach to three useful Java frameworks for building Microservices: Spring Boot, Dropwizard, and WildFly Swarm you can compare and contrast them through a handful of familiar patterns, including: *

* Exposing a service
* Configuration at runtime
* Exposing metrics/insight
* Calling downstream services in a safe manner

Explore concepts like immutable delivery and how Linux Containers and Kubernetes can be used to deploy and manage Microservices at scale with things like load-balancing, client and server-side service discovery, circuit breakers, and other features.
