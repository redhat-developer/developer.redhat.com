  Jess Sightler Contributors: Sande Gilda Published: Mar 04, 2016 Level: Intermediate
  Technologies: JMS , MDB Target Product: JBoss EAP What is it? System requirements
  Use of EAP7_HOME Prerequisites Configure the Server and Deploy the Quickstart Access

  the Server Configuration What is it? The messaging-clustering quickstart demonstrates
  the use of clustering with Apache ActiveMQ and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform. It uses the helloworld-mdb quickstart for its tests, so there is no code
  associated with this quickstart. Instructions are provided to run the quickstart
  on either a standalone server or in a managed domain. System requirements The application
  this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform 7 or later. All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8)
  or later and Maven 3.1.1 or later. See Configure Maven for JBoss EAP 7 to make sure
  you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts. Use of EAP7_HOME In the
  following instructions, replace EAP7_HOME with the actual path to your JBoss EAP
  installation. The installation path is described in detail here: Use of EAP7_HOME
  and JBOSS_HOME Variables . Prerequisites IMPORTANT: This quickstart depends on the
  deployment of the helloworld-mdb quickstart WAR for its tests. Before you continue,
  you must build the helloworld-mdb quickstart WAR. Open a command prompt and navigate
  to the root directory of the helloworld-mdb quickstart. Type this command to build
  the WAR archive: mvn clean install See the helloworld-mdb README for further information
  about this quickstart. Configure the Server and Deploy the Quickstart You can choose
  to deploy and run this quickstart in a managed domain or on a standalone server.
  The sections below describe how to configure and start the server for both modes.
  NOTE - Before you begin: If it is running, stop the JBoss EAP server. If you plan
  to test using a standalone server, backup the file: EAP7_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full-ha.xml
  If you plan to test using a managed domain, backup the following files: EAP7_HOME/domain/configuration/domain.xml
  EAP7_HOME/domain/configuration/host.xml After you have completed testing this quickstart,
  you can replace these files to restore the server to its original configuration.
  Configure the Server and Deploy the Quickstart to a Managed Domain You configure
  the server by running the install-domain.cli script provided in the root directory
  of this quickstart. Start the server in domain mode. Open a command prompt and navigate
  to the root of the JBoss EAP directory. The following shows the command line to
  start the server in domain mode: For Linux: EAP7_HOME/bin/domain.sh For Windows:
  EAP7_HOME\\bin\\domain.bat Configure the Domain Server and Deploy the Quickstart
  Using the JBoss CLI Review the install-domain.cli file in the root of this quickstart
  directory. This script creates the server group and servers and configures messaging
  clustering for testing this quickstart. You will note it does the following: Stops
  the servers Creates a server-group to test ActiveMQ Clustering Adds 2 servers to
  the server-group Configures ActiveMQ clustering in the full-ha profile Deploys the
  helloworld-mdb.war archive Restarts the servers. NOTE: If your helloworld-mdb quickstart
  is not located at the same level in the file structure as this quickstart, you must
  modify its path in this script. Find the ''NOTE:'' in the file for instructions.
  Open a command prompt, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run
  the following command to run the script: For Linux: EAP7_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect
  --file=install-domain.cli For Windows: EAP7_HOME\\bin\\jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=install-domain.cli
  You should see \"outcome\" => \"success\" for all of the commands. Restart the server
  in domain mode as described above. Configure the Server and Deploy the Quickstart
  to a Standalone Server If you choose to use standalone servers rather than domain
  mode, you will need two instances of the application server. Application server
  2 must be started with a port offset parameter provided to the startup script as
  -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100 . Since both application servers must be
  configured in the same way, you must configure the first server and then clone it.
  Start the Server in Standalone Mode using the Full HA Profile. Open a command prompt
  and navigate to the root of the JBoss EAP directory. The following shows the command
  line to start the server with the full-ha profile. This profile supports clustering/HA
  For Linux: EAP7_HOME_1/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml For Windows:
  EAP7_HOME_1\\bin\\standalone.bat -c standalone-full-ha.xml Configure the Standalone
  Server and Deploy the Quickstart Using the JBoss CLI Review the install-standalone.cli
  file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script configures clustering
  for a standalone server. You will note it does the following: Enables console logging.
  By default, the full HA profile does not log to the console, so this script enables
  it. Enables clustering and sets a cluster password Enables clustering in the RemoteConnectionFactory
  Deploys the helloworld-mdb.war archive Reloads the server configuration NOTE: If
  your helloworld-mdb quickstart is not located at the same level in the file structure
  as this quickstart, you must modify its path in this script. Find the ''NOTE:''
  in the file for instructions. Open a command prompt, navigate to the root directory
  of this quickstart, and run the following command to run the script: For Linux:
  EAP7_HOME_1/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=install-standalone.cli For Windows:
  EAP7_HOME_1\\bin\\jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=install-standalone.cli You should
  see \"outcome\" => \"success\" for all of the commands. Clone the JBoss EAP Directory
  After you have successfully configured the server, you must make a copy of this
  JBoss EAP directory structure to use for the second server. Stop the server. Make
  a copy of this JBoss EAP directory structure to use for the second server. Remove
  the following directories from the cloned instance: EAP7_HOME_2/standalone/data/activemq/bindings
  EAP7_HOME_2/standalone/data/activemq/journal EAP7_HOME_2/standalone/data/activemq/largemessages
  Start the JBoss EAP Standalone Servers with the Full HA Profile When you start the
  servers, you must pass the cluster password on the command line to avoid the warning
  \"AMQ222186: unable to authorise cluster control\". If you are using Linux: Server
  1: EAP7_HOME_1/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml -Djboss.messaging.cluster.password=password
  Server 2: EAP7_HOME_2/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml -Djboss.messaging.cluster.password=password
  -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100 If you are using Windows: Server 1: EAP7_HOME_1\\bin\\standalone.bat
  -c standalone-full-ha.xml -Djboss.messaging.cluster.password=password Server 2:
  EAP7_HOME_2\\bin\\standalone.bat -c standalone-full-ha.xml -Djboss.messaging.cluster.password=password
  -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100 Access the application Access the Application

  Investigate the Server Console Output Look at the JBoss EAP server console or log
  and you should see log messages like the following: [Server:quickstart-messagingcluster-node1]

  Remove the Server Configuration Remove the Domain Server Configuration You can remove
  the domain configuration by manually restoring the back-up copies the configuration
  files or by running the JBoss CLI Script. Remove the Domain Server Configuration
  Manually Note: This method ensures the server is restored to its prior configuration.
  If it is running, stop the JBoss EAP server. Restore the EAP7_HOME/domain/configuration/domain.xml
  and EAP7_HOME/domain/configuration/host.xml files with the back-up copies of the
  files. Be sure to replace EAP7_HOME with the path to your server. Remove the Domain
  Server Configuration by Running the JBoss CLI Script Note: This script returns the
  server to a default configuration and the result may not match the server configuration
  prior to testing this quickstart. If you were not running with the default configuration
  before testing this quickstart, you should follow the intructions above to manually
  restore the configuration to its previous state. Start the JBoss EAP server by typing
  the following: For Linux: EAP7_HOME/bin/domain.sh For Windows: EAP7_HOME\\bin\\domain.bat
  Open a new command prompt, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and
  run the following command, replacing EAP7_HOME with the path to your server. For
  Linux: EAP7_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=remove-domain.cli For Windows:
  EAP7_HOME\\bin\\jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=remove-domain.cli This script removes
  the server configuration that was done by the `install-domain.cli` script. You should
  see the following result following the script commands: The batch executed successfully.
  _Note: If the :stop-server command does not complete before the the next commands
  are issued, you may see an error similar to the following: {\"JBAS014653: Composite
  operation failed and was rolled back. Steps that failed:\" => {\"Operation step-1\"
  => \"JBAS010977: Server (quickstart-messagingcluster-node1) still running\"}} Simply
  wait a few seconds and run the command a second time. Remove the Standalone Server
  Configuration You can remove the domain configuration by manually restoring the
  back-up copies the configuration files or by running the JBoss CLI Script. Remove
  the Standalone Server Configuration Manually Note: This method ensures the server
  is restored to its prior configuration. If they are running, stop both JBoss EAP
  servers. Restore the EAP7_HOME_1/standalone/configuration/standalone-full-ha.xml
  file with the back-up copies of the file. Be sure to replace EAP7 HOME 1 with the
  path to your server. Remove the Standalone Configuration by Running the JBoss CLI
  Script Note: This script returns the server to a default configuration and the result
  may not match the server configuration prior to testing this quickstart. If you
  were not running with the default configuration before testing this quickstart,
  you should follow the intructions above to manually restore the configuration to

  Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7 or later. All you need to build this
  project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.1.1 or later. See Configure
  Maven for JBoss EAP 7 to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the
  quickstarts. Use of EAP7_HOME In the following instructions, replace EAP7_HOME with
  the actual path to your JBoss EAP installation. The installation path is described
  in detail here: Use of EAP7_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables . Start the JBoss EAP
  Server with the Full Profile Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the
  JBoss EAP directory. The following shows the command line to start the server with
  the full profile: For Linux: EAP7_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
  For Windows: EAP7_HOME\\bin\\standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml Build and Deploy
  the Quickstart Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
  Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart. Type
  this command to build and deploy the archive: mvn clean install wildfly:deploy This
  will deploy target/jboss-helloworld-mdb.war to the running instance of the server.
  Look at the JBoss EAP console or Server log and you should see log messages corresponding
  to the deployment of the message-driven beans and the JMS destinations: ... INFO
  [org.wildfly.extension.messaging-activemq] (MSC service thread 1-4) WFLYMSGAMQ0002:

  (MSC service thread 1-6) WFLYEJB0042: Started message driven bean ''HelloWorldQTopicMDB''
  with ''activemq-ra.rar'' resource adapter Access the application The application
  will be running at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/jboss-helloworld-mdb/
  and will send some messages to the queue. To send messages to the topic, use the
  following URL: http://localhost:8080/jboss-helloworld-mdb/HelloWorldMDBServletClient?topic
  Investigate the Server Console Output Look at the JBoss EAP console or Server log
  and you should see log messages like the following: INFO [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldQueueMDB]
  (Thread-9 (ActiveMQ-client-global-threads-1189700957)) Received Message from queue:
  This is message 5 INFO [class org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb.HelloWorldQueueMDB] (Thread-6

  message 3 Undeploy the Archive Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as
  described above. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this
  quickstart. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:
  mvn wildfly:undeploy Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
  You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests
  from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart,
  add a JBoss EAP server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see Use JBoss Developer
  Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts NOTE: Within JBoss Developer Studio, be
  sure to define a server runtime environment that uses the standalone-full.xml configuration
  file. Debug the Application If you want to debug the source code of any library
  in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository.
  The IDE should then detect it. mvn dependency:sources Recent Changelog Aug 21, 2015(
