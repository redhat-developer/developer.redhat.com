  Tired of waiting weeks to get a server spinning up and configuring your virtual
  servers? Come see how Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) can make you a happier and more
  productive coder. You''ll leave this hands-on session comfortable with deploying
  your own apps. You''ll learn: The meaning behind confusing acronyms like IaaS, PaaS,
  and SaaS. Why PaaS is a developers dream come true. How easy it is to get started
  with a Python (or Node or Java) web application on a PaaS. How you can complete
  all development life-cycle tasks from the command line. Bring your laptop and skepticism,
  and leave with a smile and working code. Tags: DevNation Platform As A Service (Software
