  What is it? This quickstart demonstrates creating a SOAP Web service, using code
  first style, with Apache CXF and Camel and expose it through the OSGi HTTP Service.
  We are using code first style, which means the web service is defined using Java
  code, and the JAX-WS annotations. The web service is then exposed as an endpoint
  in a Camel route. System requirements Before building and running this quick start
  you need: Maven 3.1.1 or higher JDK 1.7 or 1.8 JBoss Fuse 6 Build and Deploy the
  Quickstart Change your working directory to camel-cxf-code-first directory. Run
  mvn clean install to build the quickstart. Start JBoss Fuse 6 by running bin/fuse
  (on Linux) or bin\\fuse.bat (on Windows). In the JBoss Fuse console, enter the following
  command: osgi:install -s mvn:org.jboss.quickstarts.fuse/cxf-camel-cxf-code-first/6.2.1.redhat-084
  Fuse should give you an id when the bundle is deployed You can check that everything
  is ok by issuing the command: osgi:list your bundle should be present at the end
  of the list Use the bundle To use the application be sure to have deployed the quickstart
  in Fuse as described above. cd to the ''camel-cxf-code-first'' directory Run ''mvn
  -Ptest test Or open ''http://localhost:8181/cxf/'' in a browser to see ''OrderEndpoint''
  listed as a SOAP service. Undeploy the Archive To stop and undeploy the bundle in
  Fuse: Enter osgi:list command to retrieve your bundle id To stop and uninstall the
  bundle enter osgi:uninstall <id> Recent Changelog Mar 10, 2016( Jonathan Anstey
