Feature: Log in using preferred social provider

  As a developers.redhat customer,
  I want to log in the site using my preferred social provider,
  So that I can use its services.

  # fails with Unexpected error when authenticating with identity provider
  @logout @github_logout @delete_user @ignore
  Scenario: User can login with Social Login provider for already linked account
    Given I am on the Login page
    When I log in with an account that is already linked to my Github account
    Then I should be logged in
