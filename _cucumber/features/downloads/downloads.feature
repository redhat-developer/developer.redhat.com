Feature: Download Page - Unauthorised customer

  In order to try out Red Hat software,
  As generic site visitor,
  I want to be able to see a list of available downloads.

  Scenario: Most popular downloads should be displayed at the top of downloads page
    Given I am on the Downloads page
    Then I should see the Downloads page title
    And a "MOST POPULAR" Downloads section with the following Downloads:

    And a 'DOWNLOAD' button for each Most Popular Download
