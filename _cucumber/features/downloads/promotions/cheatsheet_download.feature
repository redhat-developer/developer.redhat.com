Feature: User can download promotional cheat sheets

  Scenario Outline: Verify that users can download cheatsheets
    Given I am on the promotion page for the "<cheat sheet>"
    When I click on the Download Now button
    And I log in with a valid username
    Then the "<file name>" download should initiate

    Examples: Cheat Sheets
      | cheat sheet        | file name                     |
      | docker-cheatsheet  | Docker_Cheat_Sheet.pdf        |
      | mongodb-cheatsheet | MongoDB_Shell_Cheat_Sheet.pdf |

  Scenario Outline: Sanity check to verify that cheat sheets are downloadable (not a physical download)
    Given I am a registered site visitor
    And I am on the promotion page for the "<url>"
    When I click on the Download Now button
    And I log in with a valid username
    Then the file should be downloadable

    Examples: Cheat Sheets
      | url                |
      | docker-cheatsheet  |
      | mongodb-cheatsheet |
