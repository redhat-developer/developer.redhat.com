        "The current hype around the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a substantial amount of innovation thanks to open source software, open hardware, open standards, and community inspiration. <br><br>
        In this session, we will explore how you can use open source software to incorporate the physical world (the “Things”) into your traditional enterprise IT infrastructure. We will walk the path from a typical enterprise developer’s current focus on web desktop applications to mobile and devices, specifically developer prototyping platforms like Raspberry Pi, Intel Edison, Arduino, Particle.io, and several others.<br><br>
        Learn how to connect the physical world to your enterprise middleware backbone via sensors and actuators."

  - title: Messaging for IoT
    date: Nov, 10 2015
    youtube_id: E68L26GmQNs
    meetup_id: '226138425'
    slides_id: 'messaging-for-iot-55150266'
    abstract: Scale changes everything. What once was quite adequate for enterprise messaging can't scale to support "Internet of Things". We need new protocols, patterns and architectures to support this new world. This session will start with basic introduction to the concept of Internet of Things. Next it will discuss general technical challenges involved with the concept and explain why it is becoming mainstream now. Now we&rsquo;re ready to start talking about solutions. We will introduce some messaging patterns (like telemetry and command/control) and protocols (such as MQTT and AMQP) used in these scenarios. Finally we will see how Apache ActiveMQ is gearing up for this race. We will show tips for horizontal and vertical scaling of the broker, related projects that can help with deployments and what the future development road map looks like.
    speaker: Martyn Taylor
    speaker_intro: Martyn Taylor is a senior software engineer at Red Hat, with over 7 years&rsquo; experience working on cloud, middleware and messaging software. Martyn currently works on the Apache ActiveMQ suite of projects.

    abstract:
        "Google App Engine (GAE) is a popular PaaS offering. Where its scalable and reliable environment is hidden behind a custom API. This makes GAE apps hard to port over to other non-GAE environments.<br><br>
        But what if one could implement such similar environment? And you could simply move your GAE application’s .war file to this new environment and it would just work?<br><br>
        After all, at the end it’s all about the API, plus scalable and reliable services.<br><br>
        JBoss CapeDwarf project aims at making this a reality. This presentation will provide a glimpse into what it takes to implement something as GAE, ranging from runtime integration with JBoss Application Server, actual services implementation to last but not least, automated heavy testing."

  - title: Transactions in the Cloud
    date: Aug 12, 2014
    youtube_id: zPCnEKr8vKM
    abstract:
        "For this meetup we have two short talks, both with a 'Transactions in the Cloud' theme. The talks cover some novel research undertaken by this summer's intern students.<br><br>
        Transactions and NoSQL Review<br><br>
        It is a common to forgo the use of transactions in an application due to untested performance or scalability concerns. While it is true that transactions do come at a cost, they also bring a lot of strong guarantees essential to a correctly running application. There are many differing transaction options available, each with varying costs and guarantees. Rather than dismiss transactions altogether, it would be more prudent to consider how your application would perform under a number of different transaction models and select the option that hits the right balance of performance and guarantees.<br><br>
        This presentation provides a useful reference for developers and architects who need the guarantees that transactions can bring, but don't know which model is right for them. In particular the presentation will:
        <ol><li>Review each of the transaction options available in NoSQL today.</li>
        <li>Compare ACID and Extended (relaxed ACID) transaction models and understand how these models relate to NoSQL and scalability.</li>
        <li>Present performance results for a selection of transaction options under different classes of workload. Covering a single node, as well as cluster of sharded nodes.</li></ol>
        Scaling a transaction manager in the Cloud<br><br>
        Transaction coordination systems such as Narayana rely upon storage facilities to recreate transaction state during recovery from a system crash. These logs are usually stored on RAID hard drives to maximize reliability. However, any disk I/O is relatively slow and writing the logs can become a bottleneck in high performance transaction systems. Using the fastest available disk subsystems is thus an expensive necessity for many enterprise applications.<br><br>
        The use of a cluster of inexpensive, unreliable hardware nodes in conjunction with data replication for redundancy is an increasingly popular and cost effective architecture for many highly scalable, high reliability applications. Data grids such as Infinispan provides distributed in-memory replication of Java objects, making programming for this kind of cluster relatively simple.<br><br>
        This presentation will cover a new transaction logging plugin for Narayana that uses a data grid to replicate the logs to main memory on other nodes in a cluster, in preference to writing them to disk. In addition, the presentation will also cover performance benchmarks and reliability trade-offs."

        "OpenShift is Red Hat's polyglot Platform as a service which allow you to run a large range of services in the cloud. In this talk I will give an introduction to OpenShift, what it offers and how it works. The talk will be in two parts. The first is about OpenShift in general and how to use it from the command line and the web console. The Second part is about how JBoss Developer Studio works with OpenShift and how it both coexist and extend the experience you get with 'plain' OpenShift. This part will focus especially on how well the JavaEE and mobile parts of Developer Studio works with OpenShift. The talk is intended to be practical and guided by attendees question."

    date: Nov 15, 2013
    youtube_id: 04qNcovQKLA
    abstract:
        "Infinispan is a distributed in memory key/value store that aims to be highly available and scalable. Its ability to scale is tightly linked to the underlying order protocol, aka atomic broadcast, used for enforcing serializability.<br>
        In this talk I will explore the scaling limits of Infinispan's existing protocol and then propose an alternative approach to designing broadcast systems, that decouples ordering and broadcast.<br><br>
        This talk contrasts our approach with Infinispan's, exploring the design features of our new approach and how they will improve Infinispan's scalability."

  - title: ThreadSafe
    date: Sep 10, 2013
    youtube_id: 601HvXyLXqk
    abstract:
        "ThreadSafe is a static analysis product for finding concurrency bugs in multi-threaded Java programs. Such bugs can be difficult to find using conventional testing methods. They may occur randomly due to non-deterministic scheduling behaviour, and can be hard to replicate. ThreadSafe analyses can be from within the Eclipse IDE, and/or in conjunction with the Sonar quality dashboard.<br><br>
        ThreadSafe is developed by Contemplate, a spin-out company from the University of Edinburgh. Following its commercial release, it has been installed by an investment bank that participated in Contemplate's Early Adopter Program, and is under evaluation in others. The design intent is not only to identify the subtle issues which can arise in multi-threaded software development, but also to provide an easy to use user experience which allows the developer to quickly understand the analysis and to take remedial action, where required, with confidence and understanding.<br><br>
        Contemplate will talk about its focus on concurrency, and demonstrate ThreadSafe's analysis of some Open Source examples."
  - title: Transaction Monitoring and Visualisation
    date: Aug 25, 2013
    youtube_id: s9qvxgfcon4
    abstract:
        "ACID Transactions are routinely used when applications require strong guarantees as to how atomic operations, involving multiple resources, will perform in the presence of failures, such as system crashes and network disruption. Transactional middleware such as JBoss, combined with application frameworks like Java EE provide the developer with a simple means to add transactional semantics to their applications. Problems can still arise, however, for example poor transactional throughput may manifest when a high volume of transactions rollback, which can have a myriad of non obvious causes.<br><br>
        This talk will explore the current methods of troubleshooting some common transactional issues using JBoss and introduce TxVis: a prototype transaction profiling and visualisation tool. We will discuss the challenges of its development and how it will aid the user in profiling the performance of transactions in their software and quickly isolate some commonly occurring problems."

    date: Aug 16, 2013
    youtube_id: 3qPrR7zinlk
    abstract:
        "Ranking queries are one of the central topics in the field of Information Retrieval with considerable applications in fields such as analytics.<br>
        One of the challenges is to provide solutions which can be adapted to distributed data sources, specifically NoSQL distributed column-oriented databases, and comply to 'user' real-time constraints, especially when dealing with massive amounts of data.<br>
        In this talk, we discuss the implementation and challenges for some of the most promising algorithms to address these challenges.<br>
        We also analyse their scalability and substantial gains in terms of bandwidth and execution time, as indicated by the experimental results."
