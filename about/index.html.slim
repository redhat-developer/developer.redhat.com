        | (Management put a lot of time on this, so we have to include it.)
      p We want to provide a complete experience to enable enterprise developers to envision, create and maintain high-value enterprise software.

          p Red Hat has historically been known for (or synonymous with) Open Source and Linux, but over the years we’ve also become known for other technologies such as middleware (JBoss), cloud (OpenShift, OpenStack), mobile (FeedHenry), containers (Docker) and more.  When used in combination, they provide a robust development portfolio for you to build enterprise applications. But as these and other technologies continue to evolve, how and when do you know when to adopt which versions? This can be time consuming. And this is how we view our role.
          p 
            | We are motivated by an unquenchable, maniacal focus to vastly redefine and improve the software developer experience. We’ll take what is rough and immature, and refine into something that is useful for building enterprise apps. Then, when we combine these technologies with humans (you) who have the spark of creation, we’ll collectively have an ever-increasing impact on the world's future economy.
            b  As a result, you’re going to lead the way in a completely free and accessible way.

            li We’re global and always online. Well, we do take turns.
            li We’ll improve code together. We will code side-by-side with you.
            li Our process is completely open and transparent: you can see the engineer working on YOUR issue, communicate with them, follow the code branch closely, test and provide feedback.
