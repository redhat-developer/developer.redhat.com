          p Red Hat has always been synonymous with Open Source and Linux, but over the years we’ve also become known for technologies such as middleware (JBoss), cloud (OpenShift, OpenStack), mobile (FeedHenry), containers (Docker) and more.  When used together, these tools provide a portfolio for you to build any enterprise application.
          p We (the Red Hat Developers community) strive to take what is rough and immature, and refine that into something that is useful for building enterprise apps. We love to share that knowledge to the world, and when we combine that with a community of inspirational humans (you), and with the spark of creativity, we shape the future of the world’s technology ecosystem - freely and accessibly. 
          p Join us to learn, code, share, and lead the way - together.

            li It’s all about the community. That means you.
            li We’re global and always online. Well, we do take turns.
            li We’ll improve code together. We will code side-by-side with you.
            li Our process is completely open and transparent: you can see the engineer working on YOUR issue, communicate with them, follow the code branch closely, test and provide feedback.
