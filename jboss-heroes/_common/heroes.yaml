- name: Jaikiran Pai
  description: Member of JBoss community since 2005. For the initial few months, I used to just hang around in the forums watching the JBoss developers and other helpful users, answer questions and help out others with all things JBoss (mostly the application server). Then I started participating actively and answering to posts and that has continued till date. In 2008, I joined the Red Hat team to be part of the core JBoss application server (now known as WildFly) development team. After 5 wonderful years at Red Hat, in 2013, I moved on and joined a startup which I'm currently part of. I still participate in the JBoss forums and hope to continue doing that.
