Emmanuel is the lead developer of Hibernate Annotations and Hibernate EntityManager, two key projects on top of Hibernate Core implementing the Java Persistence(tm) specification. He also has founded and leads Hibernate Search and Hibernate Validator.\n\nEmmanuel is a member of the JPA 2.0 expert group and the spec lead of JSR 303: Bean Validation. He is a regular speaker at various conferences and JUGs, including JavaOne, JBoss World and Devoxx and the co-author of Hibernate Search in Action published by Manning.\n\nHibernate OGM: JPA on Infinispan: when PaaS persistence meets Java EE\n\nPaaS (Platform as a Service) is all the buzz these days. But how and where do you store your data is the real challenge. In a data grid to benefit from its scalability? Via a new proprietary API?\nJBoss users of our enterprise middleware systems are accustomed to easy persistence via Hibernate and JPA (Java Persistence API). What if Hibernate could store your data in a grid?\n\nHibernate Object/Grid Mapper (OGM) aims at offering a JPA front end (object manipulation and JP-QL query) to applications while storing and querying the data from a key/value grid like Infinispan. In other words, offering a familiar and well known API but benefiting from the new scalability possibilities of distributed data grids like Infinispan. That includes trying to support existing applications using JPA.\n\nIn this presentation, we will see how JBoss is leveraging its existing technology to build an OGM (Object/Grid Mapper). Hibernate Core (JPA), Hibernate Search (object search engine), Teiid (query federation engine) and of course Infinispan (distributed data grid) are the foundation to this adventure. We will cover in details how the various bricks fit together, what the secret sauce is and how to use the solution in your applications.</p>","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/42040953","speakers":"Red Hat Developers","views":246,"likes":1,"video_thumb":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/291547636_200x150.jpg","hours":"0","minutes":"59","seconds":"54","tags":["1014"],"publish_date":"2012-05-12T17:26:42","path":"/video/vimeo/42040953"},{"title":"Java EE in the Cloud","description":"<p>In this session, Pete will introduce to OpenShift, the fi rst Platformas-a-Service available for Java EE.

Unfortunately, writing integration tests has historically involved manual setup of a heavy, cumbersome test harness. That's time lost, but it doesn't have to be anymore.\n\nHere we will introduce Arquillian, a powerful container-oriented testing framework layered atop TestNG and JUnit.

When we moved to JBoss AS7, we were expecting a relatively smooth update. In reality, we found a surprising performance story! This presentation will review performance considerations when deploying application servers across multiple cloud providers. We'll discuss to install, bootstrap, and reboot time that affect your agility with real numbers on over a dozen compute clouds like Amazon EC2.

Hibernate OGM (Object Grid Mapper) is built on the robust and proven Hibernate core engine and helps you to port existing JPA (Hibernate) applications to alternative storage engines decoupling application code from a specific NoSQL solution. The project is relatively new and not all JPA features are supported; also only one storage engine is supported at the moment: Infinispan.

In this session, we will show you how JBoss AS7 with its new architecture and a new set of features provides an ideal environment for developing and deploying Spring applications.\n\nThere are multiple ways in which a Spring developer can benefit from the overall goodness that is JBoss AS7. On one hand, you can use it as a generic Java EE 6 application server and stay up-to-date with the latest enterprise Java specification, while continuing to use your favorite development model. However, for advanced users, taking advantage of features which are unique to JBoss AS is what can provide a competitive edge, and in this webinar we will cover both angles.\n\nThis webinar is addressing developers and architects that use Spring in their applications, both new to JBoss AS or seasoned users of a previous version of it. For new users, it will demonstrate how to run Spring applications in JBoss AS7. and for existing users it will distill the new features of JBoss AS7 from a Spring user perspective, including how Snowdrop, the JBoss extension for Spring is addressing their needs.\n\nSince staying in touch with technical advances is critical for the success of an enterprise application, a question often asked is how can Spring developers blend with CDI, the Java EE 6 native dependency injection model, to create applications which are both future-proof, but also friendly to existing code, which is another important aspect of adopting JBoss AS7 as the runtime of choice. In response to that, the webinar will cover the Spring/CDI integration which currently exists as part of the Seam project.\n\nPresenter Bio: Marius Bogoevici is a Senior Software Engineer with Red Hat, leading the JBoss AS/Spring integration efforts. He is currently the lead for Snowdrop, a utility package that contains JBoss-specific extensions to the Spring Framework. He makes regular contributions to Weld, the JSR-299 Reference Implementation.\n\nMarius has an extensive experience of more than 14 years developing and architecting software systems. Prior to joining Red Hat, he was a Spring consultant with SpringSource. He is a contributor to the Spring Integration enterprise integration framework and co-author of \"Spring Integration in Action\".</p>","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/32998578","speakers":"Red Hat Developers","views":2386,"likes":4,"video_thumb":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/223659950_200x150.jpg","hours":"1","minutes":"8","seconds":"26","tags":["89","757","1370","1407","1420","774","1442"],"publish_date":"2011-12-01T23:17:04","path":"/video/vimeo/32998578/"},{"title":"Maven m2e JBoss Developer Studio 5","description":"<p>This screencast focuses on Maven and the integration with JBoss Developer Studio and Enterprise Application Platform 6.
