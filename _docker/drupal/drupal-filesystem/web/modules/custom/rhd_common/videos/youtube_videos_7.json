He begins by discussing the old methods of control and development in technology, controlled by large IT firms that gave customers what they needed, but not what they wanted. Though it was functional, user interfaces were often clumsy and hard to understand, and offerings were limited and expensive.\n\nAdvances in hardware and changing user demands have changed this landscape dramatically. Use of the Internet, mobile computing, and social media  has democratized and expanded, while the cost of providing these services has gone down. And people grew accustomed to these tools, and needed to bring them into the workplace.\n\nNewton describes how these emerging systems of engagement have changed the workplace IT strategy.  He touches on the benefits and dangers of these tools, and the widening audiences that can now participate in IT--even if they don't know that's what they're doing.\n\nSee more videos from the 2011 Red Hat Summit and JBossWorld:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/RedHatVideos#g/c/995CD1141C3330D5</p>","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jYChbK9pxA","speakers":"Red Hat Developers","views":"223","likes":"1","video_thumb":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4jYChbK9pxA/mqdefault.jpg","hours":"0","minutes":"27","seconds":"22","tags":["425","425","699","1122","859","868","155","1079","59","808","1171","1367","805","932","1140","723","838","876","405"],"publish_date":"2011-08-02T20:34:01","path":"/video/youtube/4jYChbK9pxA/"},{"title":"JBoss Enterprise Middleware overview","description":"<p>In this video from the Red Hat Stories Technologies series,  Craig Muzilla, vice president of the Middleware Business, discusses the growth and development of the JBoss Enterprise Middleware suites and technologies.

Improving our technology foundations and eliminating transaction costs means we can do more, and leaves admins and developers free to innovate instead of manage. \n\nEliminating transaction costs has also allowed for a boom in development--rapid iteration without the need for external investment (or approval).

Development teams implemented business logic and packaged their application for deployment, while system integrators came in after the fact to tie applications together.  With the introduction of Service Oriented Architecture, we began to see a shift where the design and implementation of a service was guided by a desire for application logic to be be used in multiple contexts and to take advantage of services offered by other applications without tightly coupling the implementations.  One of the biggest challenges for developers, however, was how to realize the tangible benefits of SOA without getting swallowed by the tools and frameworks designed to get them there.\n\nThis session provides an in-depth tour of how SwitchYard, the next generation Enterprise Service Bus from JBoss, gets you to SOA, easy.  There's something for everyone in this talk.  Java EE developers will see how a small set of annotations can be used to turn CDI beans into providers and consumers of enterprise services.  Inject references to enterprise services directly into your Java EE web applications!  Application integrators will witness the wonder of declarative transformation, the flexibility of policy-based service constrains, and the power of an Apache Camel-based routing engine with tons of EIP.  Business savvy folks will find multiple options for service orchestration including BPMN 2.0 and BPEL.  In the end, everyone wins when these features are tied together with rapid application development tooling, a consistent, standards-based configuration model, a top-notch testing framework, and deployment options ranging from embedded to cloud.</p>","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1V0N4juBqA","speakers":"Red Hat Developers","views":"2235","likes":"9","video_thumb":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k1V0N4juBqA/mqdefault.jpg","hours":"0","minutes":"49","seconds":"42","tags":["1157","706","1117","1166","205","1117","89","1079"],"publish_date":"2012-10-12T21:01:34","path":"/video/youtube/k1V0N4juBqA/"},{"title":"Jim Whitehurst keynote (2011 Red Hat Summit & JBoss World)","description":"<p>Red Hat President and CEO Jim Whitehurst gives the feature keynote at the 2011 Red Hat Summit and JBossWorld.\n\nHear Whitehurst speak about the principles and ideologies of openness and user-driven innovation, in technology and in life.

Many healthcare software systems do not natively interoperate with modern standards based exchanges. The Health Information Exchange at Hartford Healthcare is based on specifications and standards defined by Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (www.ihe.net). This group aims to improve the way computer systems in healthcare exchange information. One of the major difficulties encountered during this project was the lack of native interoperability between various source data systems and the Health Information Exchange implementation. \n\nTo address this need the Interoperability group implemented key functionality which facilitated the easy exchange of data between hospital based systems and the exchange. The functionality was developed as native JBoss ESB services. Along with these services a JBoss ESB native gateway was developed to facilitate the exchange of HL7 messages between various parts of the system. Beside serving as a critical part of the internal health information exchange between Hartford Healthcare entities the platform was also deployed during a statewide pilot project at 3 other hospitals.
