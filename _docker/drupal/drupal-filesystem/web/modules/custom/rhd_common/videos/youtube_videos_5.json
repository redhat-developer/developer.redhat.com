Most organizations start with tools. Should we adopt PaaS, is a container eco-system the right approach? Sadly if you currently have any legacy software or infrastructure you will soon find that these are not the hard questions you need to answer. Adopting continuous delivery practices requires change that includes organizational structure, processes and architecture. You cannot tackle one without the other as Conway's Law states they are inherently intertwined. So how do you create an organizational culture, methodology and architecture that supports rapid delivery of software, whilst still keeping your legacy systems up and running? How do you avoid common pitfalls or anti-patterns, which will hinder your ability to deliver? In this talk, I will address patterns such as micro-services, evolutionary architecture and empowered x-functional teams, which can speed up your delivery, but are not a free lunch.

We'll look at a 'low code' example to see the authoring, deployment, and usage of decision service. This example will integrate the new forms and application directory functionality. The workbench is now highly customizable and we'll demonstrate how to add new custom editors and the mash up capability of the workbench to easily add new pages and components for your domain. The 7.x engine delivers a new hybrid reasoning capability to make it much easier to work reactively with nested objects, providing a new XPath inspired notation for list comprehension, making things much more natural for Java developers. And it now has a pluggable layer for different knowledge types, and we'll discuss and demonstrate how to integrate another subsystem such as a Bayesian Network.

Reusable modules for WFM are packaged as node package manager (npm) modules, providing a consistent format for both server and client sides using Node.js and Browserify. Modules are loosely coupled using the Mediator pattern and they broadcast user actions and state changes giving the application and other modules the opportunity to hook into those events.
