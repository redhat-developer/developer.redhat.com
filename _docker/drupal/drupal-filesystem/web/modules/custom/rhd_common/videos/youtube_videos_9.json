Prior to co-founding Makara, Tobias ran development and operations for Lycos' price comparison franchise, serving many tier-1 clients such as AOL, Yahoo!, and T-Online. Before that, he served in lead technical roles at many innovative web and media companies.</p>","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0zBruo0os","speakers":"Red Hat Developers","views":"897","likes":"1","video_thumb":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lH0zBruo0os/mqdefault.jpg","hours":"1","minutes":"10","seconds":"53","tags":["89","1092","838","925","69","59"],"publish_date":"2011-10-21T14:41:55","path":"/video/youtube/lH0zBruo0os/"},{"title":"2012 Red Hat Summit: Part 2; Performance Analysis & Tuning of Red Hat Enterprise Linux","description":"<p>In this two-hour session, Douglas Shakshober (Shak) and Larry Woodman will explore the system performance analysis and tuning necessary to maximize the performance of systems running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The grouping is done via a virtual filesystem called 'cgroup.' Within this filesytem, each directory defines a new group. \n\nTunables within a cgroup are provided by what the kernel calls 'controllers.' Each controller is able to expose one or more tunable or control. When mounting the cgroups filesystem, it is possible to mount the filesystem several times, with each mount point having a different set of (non-overlapping) controllers. The key idea is that this allows the administrator to construct differing group hierarchies for different sets of controllers/tunables, which offers new ways to control and manage cloud resources.\n\nSee what else is new in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6:\nhttp://www.redhat.com/rhel/server/details/</p>","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX5QV4LId_c","speakers":"Red Hat Developers","views":"3496","likes":"28","video_thumb":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KX5QV4LId_c/mqdefault.jpg","hours":"0","minutes":"3","seconds":"5","tags":["155","425","425","425","745","1304","749","932","718","747","1084","733","9","838","876"],"publish_date":"2010-07-01T19:02:47","path":"/video/youtube/KX5QV4LId_c/"},{"title":"NUMA Programming on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, Pt 1 - Introduction to NUMA","description":"<p>In part one of this five part series on NUMA programming, Curriculum Manager George Hacker discusses NUMA concepts and terms, CLI support for NUMA, and systems calls that support NUMA.\n\nAdditional videos in the NUMA series are available to subscribers here: http://red.ht/O9bkS1.\n\nPlan | Deploy | Connect - http://red.ht/I0Ravb\n\nAlready a subscriber?
