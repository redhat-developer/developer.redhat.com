[{"title":"IPaaS 2.0: Fuse Integration Services (Robert Davies, Keith Babo)","description":"<p>Red Hat JBoss Fuse integration services delivers cloud-based integration based on OpenShift by Red Hat to deliver continuous delivery of tested, production-ready integration solutions. Utilizing a drag and drop, code-free UI and combining that with the integration power of Apache Camel, Fuse integration services is the next generation iPaaS. In this session, we'll walk you through why iPaaS is important, the current Fuse integration services roadmap, and the innovation happening in open source community projects to make this a reality.</p>","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLdDFjXI6gM","speakers":"Red Hat Developers","views":"171","likes":"1","video_thumb":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iLdDFjXI6gM/mqdefault.jpg","hours":"0","minutes":"58","seconds":"7","tags":["903"],"publish_date":"2016-10-17T17:56:46","path":"/video/youtube/iLdDFjXI6gM/"},{"title":"Developing and Deploying Cloud-Native Apps as Resilient Microservices Architectures (Edson Yanaga)","description":"<p>You've been hearing about microservices for months and have probably taken a look at 12-factor and cloud-native apps, too. But there's a myriad of frameworks and tools you can use to craft your software and join the pieces together into a microservices architecture. You want to use the best tool for the job, and you need a hassle-free DevOps pipeline to orchestrate and deploy all of them. In this session, you'll learn how to combine a lot of different technologies and tools in a live demo that will open your eyes to the huge possibilities that microservices can help you achieve. We'll have it all: containers, Docker, Wildfly Swarm, Spring Boot, NodeJS, .NET, OpenShift, Jenkins, Kubernetes, and more.</p>","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOzUlMbfZd0","speakers":"Red Hat Developers","views":"133","likes":"0","video_thumb":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HOzUlMbfZd0/mqdefault.jpg","hours":"0","minutes":"54","seconds":"58","tags":["903"],"publish_date":"2016-10-17T17:56:45","path":"/video/youtube/HOzUlMbfZd0/"},{"title":"Openshift Enterprise 3 Walk-Through With Docker And Kubernetes (Grant Shipley)","description":"<p>Everyone's heard about Docker and how it's going to solve all of our problems, or not.

While NoSQL datastores offer interesting benefits in the BigData world we enter, choosing the right one for your project can be challenging. Abstracting behind JPA relieves you from the programming API/model shift. But is it possible? In this presentation, we will give an brief overview of the NoSQL landscape, describe how Hibernate OGM persists data in key/value stores, document stores, column family stores, etc. and see where using such an abstraction makes sense in applications. After this presentation, you will have a clearer view on how to integrate NoSQL datastores in your Java projects at least via JPA.\n\nPresenter: Emmanuel Bernard\n\nBio: Emmanuel Bernard is data platform architect at Red Hat JBoss Middleware and member of the Hibernate team.
