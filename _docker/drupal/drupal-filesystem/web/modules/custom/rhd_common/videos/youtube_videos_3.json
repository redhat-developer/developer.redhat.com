[{"title":"DevNation 2014 - Donnie Berkholz - Distros Failed Us. Now What?","description":"<p>Recent trends in software development like cloud and DevOps have raised questions as to whether package management in Linux distributions is still relevant. Whether it's independent package managers in popular Web frameworks and languages (Node.js, Ruby, Python, etc) or bundling and containerization that's become increasingly popular in the cloud and in DevOps culture, it appears that integrated approaches to package management are on the decline. Yet at the same time we've seen package managers in the Windows world such as NuGet grow more popular. This talk from experienced distribution leader and RedMonk analyst Donnie Berkholz will explore the reasoning and history behind this shift, whether it's the right move for the FLOSS movement as a whole, and the glimmerings of solutions to these existential problems.</p>","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnHR22vXgvo","speakers":"Red Hat Developers","views":"4","likes":"0","video_thumb":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BnHR22vXgvo/mqdefault.jpg","hours":"0","minutes":"51","seconds":"51","tags":["903","49"],"publish_date":"2014-05-06T06:01:24","path":"/video/youtube/BnHR22vXgvo/"},{"title":"DevNation 2014 - Grant Shipley - Full-stack Javascript from Mobile to Cloud","description":"<p>Grant Shipley, lead evangelist for OpenShift by Red Hat, will demonstrate how to develop iPhone and Android apps with MongoDB back ends for the cloud.

Or is it? With microservices, polyglot, and DevOps on the rise, where are we at with testing? Do these technologies bring more complexity and make our testing effort harder, or maybe the contrary? Do they actually help us write better tests more easily? This session explores not only how we can do our testing in this new world but also how the new world can help us test better. It takes a close look at various topics, from NodeJS-, DynJS-, VertX-, Ceylon-, or Ruby-orchestrated microservices through system-scale testing with various configurations to database migration and regression testing.

However, it wasn’t until Java EE 5, in 2006, that extensions were really talked about. In Java EE 5, we received Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI). Along with the namesake of the specification, extensions were introduced. Together we have the ability to extend the platform to do whatever we need. The possibilities of these extensions are limited only by your imagination. You’ve heard about CDI and the extensibility of Java EE 6 and seen enough to pique your curiosity. This session will sate that curiosity and give you enough information to build great extensions for your application and business.</p>","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-Po2phF-_M","speakers":"Red Hat Developers","views":"133","likes":"2","video_thumb":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I-Po2phF-_M/mqdefault.jpg","hours":"0","minutes":"41","seconds":"59","tags":["821","1126"],"publish_date":"2015-10-27T15:01:23","path":"/video/youtube/I-Po2phF-_M/"},{"title":"NetBeans Now Knows WildFly","description":"<p>Talking to the NetBeans WildFly Plugin Maintainer Emmanuel Hugonnet (@ehsavoie) about his History with NetBeans and WildFly and Community and Source Code.</p>","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN0Fa7cczcQ","speakers":"Red Hat Developers","views":"753","likes":"0","video_thumb":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AN0Fa7cczcQ/mqdefault.jpg","hours":"0","minutes":"17","seconds":"51","tags":["696","1000"],"publish_date":"2014-08-13T15:36:12","path":"/video/youtube/AN0Fa7cczcQ/"},{"title":"Developer Interviews (DI 2) Claus Ibsen About all Things Camel","description":"<p>Talking to Claus Ibsen (@davsclaus) about Apache Camel, the upcoming 2.14 release and cool new features in Hawtio</p>","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPhwfbfCAfE","speakers":"Red Hat Developers","views":"809","likes":"6","video_thumb":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fPhwfbfCAfE/mqdefault.jpg","hours":"0","minutes":"36","seconds":"26","tags":["1000","735","1005","1300"],"publish_date":"2014-08-19T10:55:49","path":"/video/youtube/fPhwfbfCAfE/"},{"title":"Developer Interviews (#DI 3) Christian Posta (@christianposta) on fabric8","description":"<p></p>","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ag5Ue_HJ6I","speakers":"Red Hat Developers","views":"652","likes":"3","video_thumb":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ag5Ue_HJ6I/mqdefault.jpg","hours":"0","minutes":"40","seconds":"51","tags":["696","698","952","1300","821"],"publish_date":"2014-09-08T12:26:57","path":"/video/youtube/-ag5Ue_HJ6I/"},{"title":"Developer Interviews (#DI 4) Stan Lewis (@gashcrumb) about #hawtio","description":"<p>This time it is Stan Lewis who spend some of his precious early morning minutes on talking about what he loves doing the most.
