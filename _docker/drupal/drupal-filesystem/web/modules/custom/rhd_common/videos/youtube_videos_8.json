In order to deliver high-performance capabilities, Accenture considers open source a key component.\n\nAccenture has continued to see a rise in open source adoption and expansion because of better quality, security, flexibility, and opportunity delivered by companies like Accenture and its partners (including Red Hat). These alliances work hard with their customers to create ever-improving innovative business solutions.\n\nDaugherty also discusses trends and shifts in the technology industry, including cloud computing, data, analytics, and architectures, and examines how today's computing is service-centric instead of server-centric. These developments only heighten the importance of security and access control.

A service oriented, modular architecture will help a lot to achieve this goal. Modularity forces separation of concerns which, when combined with a service oriented architecture, enables you to replace parts of a system without breaking others. The only mature modularity approach for Java is OSGi. OSGi is a framework that enables low-level modularity and services, but it is not an application framework like Java EE, i.e.  you still need APIs to create web applications, use transactions, access data sources etc. Without these APIs you will have a hard time to actually build applications. Unfortunately OSGi and Java EE did not interoperate well in the past; it was very challenging to mix both. But what if we want modularity in our architecture, but also the ease-of-use of Java EE 6?\n\nLuckily times are changing. All major application servers are getting support for deploying mixed Java EE and OSGi applications. This makes it possible to deploy OSGi bundles that contain Java EE 6 code such as EJBs, JPA and JAX-RS resources. CDI can be used to inject OSGi services and EJBs can easily be exported as OSGi services too.\n\nThe next question is how to deploy this into the cloud. Just uploading a large WAR file to a server in the cloud doesn't fit modularity very well. How can you update just parts of a running application without breaking the rest of it? We will introduce Apache ACE, an Open Source Provisioning Platform to deploy OSGi bundles (containing Java EE code) and other artifacts to the cloud.</p>","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpWl_mxVoJE","speakers":"Red Hat Developers","views":"2951","likes":"1","video_thumb":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RpWl_mxVoJE/mqdefault.jpg","hours":"0","minutes":"56","seconds":"4","tags":["1157","425","706","89","205","838","1238","1110"],"publish_date":"2012-10-12T21:16:58","path":"/video/youtube/RpWl_mxVoJE/"},{"title":"2012 Red Hat Summit: An Overview of Red Hat Cloud & Systems Management Portfolio","description":"<p>This video provids an overview of Red Hat cloud and systems management portfolio, presented by Chris Wells, Joe Fernandes, and Katie Kelley. \n\nRed Hat became far more than just the premier open source Linux solution provider long ago.
