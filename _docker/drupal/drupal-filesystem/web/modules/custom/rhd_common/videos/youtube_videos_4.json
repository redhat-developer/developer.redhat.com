And every application is different, so you want to be able to fully control every bit of it. Using process-driven application development, you define your application logic in a (flexible) business process, but you also expect your BPM system to help you out with much more than that. In this session we will show you live how to quickly get new web applications up and running by relying on jBPM to provide some of the UI (should you want to), or even to generate parts of your application for you (that you can customize later), so you can focus on what makes your application different. jBPM uses the power of open source and it's flexible architecture to let you decide what you need: nothing more, nothing less.</p>","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW4__q2iaJs","speakers":"Red Hat Developers","views":"1555","likes":"11","video_thumb":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oW4__q2iaJs/mqdefault.jpg","hours":"1","minutes":"1","seconds":"53","tags":["909","906","908"],"publish_date":"2015-11-13T09:08:52","path":"/video/youtube/oW4__q2iaJs/"},{"title":"CDI 2.0 is coming by Antoine Sabot-Durand/Jos√© Paumard","description":"<p>The work on JSR 365 (Context and Dependency Injection for Java) started one year ago.

Nevertheless the biggest part of Java developers is not used yet to employ functional idioms and then they are not ready to fully leverage the new functional capabilities of Java. In particular it is still uncommon to see functions used together with data in business domain model. The purpose of this talk is not doing a comparison between object oriented and functional programming, but showing how these two styles can be combined in order to take advantage of the good parts of both. For example it's usual to pass a list of data to a function that processes them, but there are cases when you may want to create a list of functions and pass a single data through all of them. Immutable objects leads to a inherently thread-safe domain model. Functions often compose better than objects. Side-effect free code allows better reusability. This talk will demonstrate the validity of these statements with practical examples till to distil the essence of functional programming: data and behaviours are two aspects of the same thing.</p>","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6BmGBzIqW0","speakers":"Red Hat Developers","views":"7972","likes":"89","video_thumb":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K6BmGBzIqW0/mqdefault.jpg","hours":"0","minutes":"55","seconds":"57","tags":["909","906","908"],"publish_date":"2015-11-13T09:08:51","path":"/video/youtube/K6BmGBzIqW0/"},{"title":"JRuby 9000 by Charles Nutter","description":"<p>Ruby has come a long way since JRuby first ran Rails in 2006.
