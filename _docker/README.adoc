= Drupal Setup
Jason Porter <jporter@redhat.com>

This docker compose setup builds and creates the images for use with drupal (php, apache httpd, drupal) and mysql.

== Usage

On the first use, issue the following commands:

....
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
....

Subsequent uses should be able to simply use

....
$ docker-compose start
....

The first use will create the database, download drush and drupal and also set drupal up to accept rest calls via the API on `localhost:8081`, or the IP address of the docker container when using `boot2docker`.
This first run may take a few minutes to put everything in place.
When you see that Apache Httpd couldn't find the `ServerName` everything should be ready to go.

The MySQL database is also exposed on port 13306.
