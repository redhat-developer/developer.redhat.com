From classic or full-text queries, to Spark/Hadoop integrations via distributed Java Streams, these wide ranging data processing capabilities make Infinispan the perfect choice for the Big Data era.<br/><br/>In this session, we will identify critical patterns and principles that will help you achieve greater scale and response speed.

He is very keen on functional programming and has been developing Scala since 2009. Lately he's been learning Haskell and has been presenting Elm based Infinispan demos. Prior to joining Red Hat, Galder worked in the Retail industry where he was a software developer involved in the development of an EFT software switch solution based on JBoss technologies. The love for distributed systems and open source software comes from his days at ESIDE faculty at University of Deusto (Bilbao, Spain) where he studied a master's degree in Computer Science."

            "abstract": "Reactive Programming, Reactive eXtensions, Reactive Streams, Reactive Systems, Reactive Manifesto, that’s a lot of 'reactive' thingies. Just to make it even more confusing, 'reactive' is often associated with asynchronous, scalability, RX libraries (RX Java, RX JS), back pressure, streams, observables, futures, promises, spreadsheets and so on…. That's a lot to digest… This session helps you understanding what's behind the 'reactive' word. It explores the reactive landscape and explains what all these 'things' are and how they are related. Attendees don't only learn what does 'reactive' mean, but also how it is related to their projects and applications. By providing a global overview of the reactive landscape, this session also provides to the attendees a general understanding of the 'reactive' trend, and why it matters. The presentation uses several live coding demos to explain the different concepts. It uses Eclipse Vert.x as a playground to explain how all these concepts work together. Eclipse Vert.x is a toolkit to build reactive and distributed systems on the JVM. It supports a set of languages such as Java, JavaScript, Ceylon, Scala and Kotlin… but also a set of programming styles (callbacks, futures, streams, RX...). It covers a large part of the reactive spectrum making it a great choice to implement reactive applications and systems.",

I have been involved in projects and products touching many domains and technologies such as OSGi, mobile app development, continuous delivery, DevOps… My main point of interest? Software engineering, so processes, methods, tools that make the development of software more efficient and also more fun. I’m also an active contributor to many open source projects such as Apache Felix, iPOJO, Wisdom Framework, and obviously, Eclipse Vert.x."

Of these servers, one of the most promising is Keycloak, open-source, flexible and agnostic of any technology, it is easily deployable / adaptable in its own infrastructure. In this session, I propose you to discover KeyCloak progressively and in an interactive way: 0 slide, 100% live coding.<br/><br/>We will naturally focus on the Spring Boot adapter that Keycloak provides but also see how you can combine Spring Security with Keycloak.",
