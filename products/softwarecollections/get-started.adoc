Introduction and Prerequisites

## Prerequisites section
In this tutorial, you will set your system up to install software from Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL), which provides the latest development technologies for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Then, you will install Node.js and run a simple “Hello, World” application. The whole tutorial will take less than ten minutes to complete.

You will need a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 system that is has a current Red Hat subscription and is able to receive software updates. Access to the Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) is included with many Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) subscriptions. For more information about which subscriptions include RHSCL, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/472793[How to use Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) or Red Hat Developer Toolset (DTS)?]

If you don’t have a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Subscription, you can try it for free. Get started with an evaluation at link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation[].
Select the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Workstation option to ensure your evaluation will include both RHSCL and DTS.

If you have problems at any point, see the troubleshooting section of this article.

## Step1 Content

In this step you will configure your system to obtain software, including the latest dynamic languages, from the RHSCL software repository. Instructions are provided for both the command line (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI).

### Using the Red Hat Subscription Manager GUI

Red Hat Subscription Manager can be started from the _System Tools_ group of the _Applications Menu_. Alternatively, you can start it from the command prompt by typing `subscription-manager-gui`. +

Select _Repositories_ from the System menu of the subscription manager. In the list of repositories, check the _Enabled_ column for _rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms_ and _rhel-7-server-optional-rpms_. If you are using a desktop version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the repositories will be named _rhel-desktop-rhscl-7-rpms_ and _rhel-7-desktop-optional-rpms_. +
 
If you don’t see any RHSCL repositories in the list your subscription may not include it, see the troubleshooting section for more information. +

### Using subscription-manager from the command line

You can add or remove software repositories from the command line using the `subscription-manager` tool as root.  If you are using a desktop edition of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, change `-server-` to `-desktop-` in the following commands.

[.code-block]
```
$ su
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
```

To view the available software repositories use the --list option.

`# subscription-manager repos --list | egrep rhscl`

If you don’t see any RHSCL repositories in the list your subscription may not include it, see the troubleshooting section for more information.

## Step2 Content

In this next step you will Install Node.js 0.10 from RHSCL.

[.code-block]
```
$ su
# yum install nodejs010
```

Note: The V8 JavaScript runtime is installed automatically as a dependency. +

If you need help, see troubleshooting section of this article.

## Step3 Content

Under your normal user id, start a terminal session.  First, we will use scl enable to add Node.js to your environment, then we start  `node` to check the version.

[.code-block]
```
$ scl enable nodejs010 bash
$ node --version
v0.10.35
```

Now we will create a JavaScript program that can be run from the command line. Using your preferred text editor, create `hello.js`: 

`$ nano hello.js`


[.code-block]
```
console.log("Hello, Red Hat Developers World!")
```

Save it and exit the editor. Run it with the `node` command:
[.code-block]
```
$ node ./hello.js
Hello, Red Hat Developers World
```

If you get an error that node is not found, you need to run `scl enable nodejs010` first.

Now we will try a slightly larger Node.js example that implements a tiny web server.  Using your preferred text editor, create `hello-http.js`:

`$ nano hello-http.js`


[.code-block]
```
var http = require('http');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    res.end('Hello, Red Hat Developers World!\n');
}).listen(8000, '127.0.0.1');
console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/');
```

Save it and exit the editor. Run it with the `node` command:

`$ node ./hello-http.js`

Now use Firefox or your preferred browser to connect to the Node.js web server `http://localhost:8000/`.


### Working with RHSCL packages

The software packages in RHSCL are designed to allow multiple versions of software to be installed concurrently. To accomplish this, the desired package is added to your runtime environment as needed by running scl enable package. When scl enable is run it modifies environment variables which only affects the current shell and any processes that are run from it. The changes aren’t permanent, so scl enable needs to be run at each login.

While it is possible to change the system profile to make RHSCL packages part of the system’s global environment this is not recommended as this can cause conflicts and unexpected problems with other applications as the system version of the package would be effectively replaced by the RHSCL version.

#### Permanently enable RHSCL in your development environment

To make one or more RHSCL packages a permanent part of your development environment, you can add it to the login script for your specific user id. this is the recommend approach for development as only processes run under your user id will be affected.

Using your prefered text editor, add the following line to ~/.bashrc:

`source scl_source enable nodejs010`

When you deliver an application that uses RHSCL packages, a best practice is to have your startup script handles the scl enable step for your application. You should not ask your users to change their environment as this is likely to create conflicts with other applications.

### Where to go next?

*Learn Node.js and JavaScript using NodeSchool.io tutorials* +

Now that you have Node.js installed, use the tutorials from link:http://nodeschool.io/#workshopper-list[nodeschool.io] to learn Node.js and JavaScript. You need to have already run `scl enable nodejs010 ...` or have added Node.js permanently to development environment.  

Install the JavaScript and Node.js tutorial in your current directory:
[.code-block]
```
$ npm install javascripting
$ npm install learnyounode`
```

Temporarily add node_modules/.bin to your PATH:

`$ export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/node_modules/.bin`


Run the JavaScript tutorial:

`$ javascripting`

Run the Node.js tutorial:

`$ learnyounode`

*View documentation on the Nodejs.org web site* +
link:http://nodejs.org/documentation/[]

*Find additional RHSCL Node modules* +
`$ yum list available nodejs\*`

*View the list of software available in RHSCL* +
`$ yum --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms" list available`

Troubleshooting and FAQ

## Faq section

1. The rhscl repository is not available or is not found on my system.
+
The name of the repo depends on whether you have ‘server’ or ‘desktop’ version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installed.
+
Some Red Hat Enterprise Linux Subscriptions do not include access to RHSCL. See link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/472793[How to use Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) or Red Hat Developer Toolset (DTS)?]
2. yum install fails due to a missing dependency such as scl-utils-build or texlive-*.
+
These packages are in the RHEL Optional RPMS repository which is not enabled by default. See the “Enable Red Hat Software Collections” step of this tutorial for how to enable both the Optional RPMS and RHSCL repositories.
3. How can I find out what RHSCL packages are installed?
+
scl --list will show the list of RHSCL packages that have been installed whether they are enabled or not.
+
[.code-block]
```
$ scl --list
nodejs010
v8314
```
4. How do I find out if there is a newer version of Node.js in the RHSCL?
+
How do I find out what version of Node.js is available in the current RHSCL?
+
I have the RHSCL repository enabled, but I can’t find the Node.js version listed in this tutorial?
+
`# yum list available nodejs\*`
5. I’ve installed Node.js from RHSCL, but `node` is not in my path?
+
I can’t find the `node` command?
+
RHSCL does not alter the system path.  You need to use scl enable to change the PATH for your session:
+
`$ scl enable nodejs010 bash`
+
For more information see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Software_Collections/2/index.html[Red Hat Software Collection 2.0 Documentation]
6. When I try to run node, I get an error about a missing shared library?
+
This is due to not having run ‘scl enable’ first. When scl enable is run, in addition to setting up the command search path, it also sets up the search path for shared libraries, LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
