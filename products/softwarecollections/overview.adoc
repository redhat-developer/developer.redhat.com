== Overview

When developing applications for Red Hat Enterprise Linux®, developers have two major tools chains to utilize.  First, Red Hat Enterprise Linux has a base toolchain that are included with the same support lifecycle.  These tools are added with the original dot-zero release of RHEL and include Python, gcc, PHP, Ruby, Perl, and more.  For developers who are looking for updated tools, Red Hat® Software Collections delivers the latest stable versions of dynamic languages, open source databases, web development tools, and other important development resources that can be deployed alongside those included in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux® base tool chain. Red Hat Software Collections is available with select Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions and has a three-year life cycle to allow rapid innovation without sacrificing stability. 

*Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL)* allow you to build and concurrently install multiple versions of the same software components on your system. Packages built using software collections technology do not overwrite system files and can depend on other software collections.  In addition, dockerfiles are available for each Software Collection component for developing in containers, and are identical to the development stacks available on OpenShift.  This means you can develop or deploy on either Red Hat Enterprise Linux or OpenShift.

Now available as version 2, the entire list of Red Hat Software Collections 2 components can be found https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Software_Collections/2/html/2.0_Release_Notes/chap-RHSCL.html#sect-RHSCL-Changes[here], and includes these popular items plus many more:

* Python 3.4
* Ruby 2.2
* PHP 5.6
* Perl 5.20
* Node.js 0.10
* MariaDB 10.0
* Mongo 2.6
* PostgreSQL 9.4
* Apache httpd 2.4
* Passenger 4.0
* Much, much, more
