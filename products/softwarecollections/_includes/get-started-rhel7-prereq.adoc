## Prerequisites section
In this tutorial, you will set your system up to install software from Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL), which provides the latest development technologies for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Then, you will install {tthw-langlong} and run a simple “Hello, World” application. The whole tutorial should take less than 10 minutes to complete.

Before you begin, you will need a current Red Hat Enterprise Linux {tthw-rhelver} server or workstation subscription that allows you to download software and get updates from Red Hat. Developers can get a no-cost Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Suite subscription for development purposes by link:#{site.download_manager_base_url}/download-manager/link/1350474[registering and downloading] through link:#{site.base_url}/[developers.redhat.com].
