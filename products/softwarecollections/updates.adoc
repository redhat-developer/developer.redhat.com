== Using Red Hat Software Collections for container development

Most RHSCL collections are available as docker-formatted container images from the Red Hat Container Registry. This makes it easy to build and deploy applications in containers that use RHSCL components. See the release notes for a full list of new and updated collections.

In addition, Dockerfiles used to build the RHSCL container images are available as RHSCL rpm on RHEL 7. These source Dockerfiles can be used for customizing or rebuilding containers with RHSCL components.
