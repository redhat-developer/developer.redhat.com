*NOTE:* If you haven't directly downloaded the Red Hat Development Suite from Red Hat Developers, your account may not have the correct entitlements to install the Container Development Kit. The easiest way to add the entitlements is to visit Red Hat Developers and initiate a download of the Red Hat Development Suite. We are working on a fix to enable you to add the entitlements to your account without starting a new download.
. Choose the folder you wish to use to install Red Hat Development Suite, and click _Continue_.
