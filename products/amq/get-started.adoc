The hello world example uses maven to download dependent libraries from Red Hat. You will need to add these libraries to your development IDE in order for the example to work.
+
a. Open JBoss Developer Studio preferences, expand _J​BossTools_ ​and select _J​Boss Maven Integration_.
* On Windows, click _Windows -> Preferences_.

*Download, install and configure JBoss A-MQ:*

1. *Download and extract:*
+
a. Download the latest version of Red Hat JBoss A-MQ. The latest
at the time of this writing is link:#{site.download_manager_file_base_url}/jboss-amq-6.2.1.GA.zip[Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.2.1 GA].
b. Unzip JBoss-AQ to your favorite destination. The document will refer to this directory as AMQ_HOME (We use C:\opt\redhat\jboss-amq on Windows.)
* On Windows or Mac, you can extract the contents of the ZIP archive by double clicking on the ZIP file.
* On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, open a terminal window in the target machine and navigate to where the ZIP file was downloaded. Extract the ZIP file by executing the following command:
+
`unzip jboss-a-mq-6.2.1.redhat-084.zip`
+
2. *Add users to A-MQ:*
+
Edit the file `AMQ_HOME/etc/user.properties`. Uncomment the last line so that systems can connect and access the message broker. The last line of the user.properties file has a `#` mark as the first character. Delete it and save the file. The edited last line should now look similar to this:
+
`admin=admin,admin,manager,viewer,Operator,Maintainer,Deployer, Auditor,Administrator,SuperUser`
+
3. *Start the A-MQ broker:* Scripts to start and stop the A-MQ broker are found within the `AMQ_HOME/bin` directory.
* For Windows: Double-click on the `AMQ/bin/start.bat` file and accept security pop-ups as they appear.
* For Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Mac: Execute the following command:
+
`AMQ_HOME/bin/start`
+
TIP: To check the status of the A-MQ broker you can execute the status script found in the same directory as the start script. To learn more about the various scripts see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_A-MQ/6.2/html/Console_Reference/index.html[customer portal].​
+
* *Next Steps:* Congratulate yourself. You have just installed and started the JBoss A-MQ Broker. Next up, Install the developer environment...
