== Detail

Core messaging is provided by Apache ActiveMQ supporting different messaging paradigms like publish-subscribe, point-to-point, store-and-forward. Multi-protocol support (JMS 1.1, TCP, SSL, STOMP, NMS) and multi-client support (Java, C, C++) enables real-time messaging with all enterprise assets. In addition JBoss A-MQ is hosted on a lightweight OSGI-based runtime container, Apache Karaf. JBoss A-MQ is also supported to work with certified Java EE platform, link:http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform[Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform]. JBoss Developer Studio provides an easy-to-use integration development environment built on Eclipse.
