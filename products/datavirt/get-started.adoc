== Step3 Content
Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization allows you to easily combine data from multiple, heterogenous data sources without moving or copying any data. In this example application you will be building federated data views pulling data from Flat file, Web and H2 relational database. These federated data views can be easily accessed via any JDBC client or Web Service.

*Follow the steps* of https://vimeo.com/178933702[Part 2] and https://vimeo.com/178933177[Part 3] from Getting Started video series to build your first data virtualization project.
