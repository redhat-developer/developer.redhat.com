== Step1 Content
1.	Open a terminal window and navigate to the location where the GUI installer was downloaded.
2.	Enter the following command to launch the GUI installer: `java -jar jboss-dv-installer-6.2.0.redhat-3.jar`
3.	A dialogue box will open followed by the End User License Agreement. If you accept the terms of the agreement, click *I accept the terms of this license agreement* and then click *Next*.
4.	Click Next (a new folder for JBoss EAP server is created). Incase, JBoss EAP is already installed; tell Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization where Red Hat JBoss EAP is installed. Add the file path and click *Next*
5.	Ensure *Teiid Installation* and *Modeshape Installation* are selected. Click *Next*.
6.	You will be prompted to create a new EAP Admin, Dashboard Admin, Teiid data access user and ModeShape user and whether you want to enable OData access and a logging role. Once created, these are added to the AdminRealm and can be used to access the Management Console and other applications secured using ManagementRealm. Enter the new username and password in the appropriate fields and click *Next*.
You must ensure that you remember all of these passwords. They give you access to different parts of the system. The EAP account and password allows you to administer the EAP Server, the Dashboard password is for administrative functions related to the web interface, and the Teiid data access user and ModeShape user are for standard user access.
+
*Note* that the username and password are not allowed to match and the password must have at least eight characters, with one alphabetical character, one numeric character and one non-alpha-numeric character.
7.	You can install Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization either with default configuration or with additional configuration options. For this exercise, we will be using the defaults only, so select *Perform default configuration* to install Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization with default options (the Database logging configuration is the only option selected by default). Click *Next*.
8.	The Configure password vault screen appears. Input your desired password, which must have no fewer than six characters. Click *Next*.
*NOTE*
The default H2 database is not suitable for production databases. Use it in testing and evaluation environments only.
A summary of the installation is displayed. Click *Next* for the installation to commence. This may take a few moments. Once all the components are installed, click *Next* again.
9.	Click *Generate an installation script and properties file* if you wish to generate a script for automatic future installations. This script allows you to quickly reinstall or mass-deploy the product using the settings you have configured during the initial installation, without having to step through the wizard each time.
10.	Make a note of the URLs of the Administration Console and the Data Virtualization Dashboard and click *Done* to exit the installer.
