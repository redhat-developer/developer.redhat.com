#### A Tried, Tested and Trusted open source implementation of the Java platform

OpenJDK 8 (Open Java Development Kit) is a free and open source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE).

All Red Hat distributions of OpenJDK 8 on Windows are supported for development of applications that work in conjunction with JBoss Middleware, so that you have the convenience and confidence to develop and test in Windows or Linux-based environments and deploy your solution to a 100% compatible, fully supported, OpenJDK 8 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
