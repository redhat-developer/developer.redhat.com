In this step, you will download Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server. For the download, you will need to register with developers.redhat.com. After you register as a developer, you will be given a subscription for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Suite. Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server and additional development tools are included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Suite.

Download the #{site.download_manager_base_url}/download-manager/file/rhel-server-7.2-x86_64-dvd.iso[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server DVD] `.iso` file.

Note: Later in this guide, you will need the Red Hat username and password you create during registration for accessing Red Hat sites.

// Step2 Install - Baremetal version, keep this in sync with VM versions

## Step2 Baremetal Content

This section provides an overview of the key steps for installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux so you can get started with software development. Note: This tutorial does not replace the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation Guide, window='_blank']. Instead, this tutorial provides an overview of the key steps for software developers. For detailed instructions, see the respective manual.

A few things to keep in mind:

. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server `.iso` you downloaded in step 1 will be used to install a system with a full graphical desktop. You will select _Server with a GUI_ under _Software Selection_ during installation. By default, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server will not install a graphical desktop.
. You will need to select an _Installation destination_, which is the disk or partition(s) where the software will be installed. *The disk or partition(s) you select will be overwritten.* Make sure you understand your selection before starting the installation to avoid accidental data loss.
. You should configure networking under _Network and host name_ before starting the installation. You will need access to the Internet to complete registration and download additional software. The network can be configured after the system is installed. However, the steps are more straightforward during installation.
. Create your primary user account during installation: After the installation begins, you will be instructed to set a password for the root account and be given the opportunity to create a regular user account. You should create a user before the installation process completes. The regular user will be your primary login for development. The root account should only be used for system administration tasks. If you don't create a user before the installation completes, you will need to reboot and then log in as root to create user accounts.

### System Requirements

The requirements for your physical system are:

* a 64-bit x86 machine.

The VM you create will give you a Red Hat Enterprise Linux development environment that you can use on your system running Microsoft Windows 10, 8.1, or 8.0.

### Overview of steps

. Enable Hyper-V
. Configure a VM to run Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
. Boot the VM using the ISO file you downloaded in step 1 as a virtual DVD.
. Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Note: This tutorial does not replace the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation Guide, window='_blank'] or Microsoft Hyper-V documentation. Instead, this tutorial provides an overview of the key steps for software developers. For detailed instructions, see the respective manual.

A few things to keep in mind:

* You will be using the Server edition of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This provides you with the widest range of software to develop and test with.
* The VM will have a full graphical desktop. You will select _Server with a GUI_ during installation.
* After installation, you will configure additional software repositories that will provide you access to optional development software such as RHSCL and DTS.

### System Requirements

The requirements for your physical system that will host the Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM are:

* a 64-bit x86 machine with hardware virtualization assistance (Intel VT-X or AMD-V) and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation[Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), window='_blank'].
* Microsoft Windows 10, 8.1 or 8.0.
* 4 GB RAM (8 GB preferred).
* 24 GB of available disk space for the VM, the installation ISO file, and Hyper-V.

+
. Click _OK_.
. Close the _Programs and Features_ window.

For more information see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyperv_on_windows/quick_start/walkthrough_install[Install Hyper-V on Windows 10, window='_blank'] or consult the documentation for your version of Microsoft Windows. Note: some of the Hyper-V documentation may be listed as "Client Hyper-V" since Hyper-V was originally a server feature.


#### Enable Intel VT-x or AMD-V Virtualization in BIOS/UEFI

Intel and AMD processors have hardware extensions for accelerating virtualization. On some systems this support may be disabled by default in the system’s BIOS/UEFI. To enable the extensions, you might have to go into the system’s BIOS/UEFI setup configuration at boot time. Consult your system’s hardware documentation for more information.


### Create and configure a VM in Hyper-V

In this step, you will create and configure the VM that will run Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The physical system you are running Hyper-V on is called the _host system_ or _root partition_. The VM is called the guest system or _child partition_.

First, launch _Hyper-V Manager_ from the Windows menu.

image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/hyperv/hv-02-hyperv-manager.png')}[Screenshot Hyper-V Manager]

## Step2 KVM Content

This step provides an overview of the key steps for installing #{site.base_url}/products/rhel/overview/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server] in a Virtual Machine (VM) running on your Linux system using KVM/libvirt virtualization. The VM you create will give you a Red Hat Enterprise Linux development environment that will run on Fedora, CentOS, Ubuntu, or other Linux. Instructions are shown for Fedora 23 and Ubuntu 14.04, however these steps should work on other Linux distributions that include KVM and libvirt tools including `virt-manager`.

### Overview of steps

. Install KVM and libvirt tools
. Configure a VM to run Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
. Boot the VM using the ISO file you downloaded in step 1 as a virtual DVD.
. Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Note: This tutorial does not replace the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation Guide, window='_blank'] or your system's virtualization documentation such as the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/23/html-single/Virtualization_Getting_Started_Guide/index.html[Fedora Virtualization Getting Started Guide, window='_blank']. Instead, this tutorial provides an overview of the key steps for software developers. For detailed instructions, see the respective manual.

A few things to keep in mind:

* You will be using the Server edition of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This provides you with the widest range of software to develop and test with.
* The VM will have a full graphical desktop. You will select _Server with a GUI_ during installation.
* After installation, you will configure additional software repositories that will provide you access to optional development software such as RHSCL and DTS.

### System Requirements

The requirements for your physical system that will host the Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM are:

* a 64-bit x86 machine with hardware virtualization assistance (Intel VT-X or AMD-V).
* 4 GB RAM (8 GB preferred).
* 24 GB of available disk space for the VM and the installation ISO file.

If you encounter difficulties at any point in this tutorial, see <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>>.

### Enable Intel VT-x or AMD-V Virtualization in BIOS/UEFI

Intel and AMD processors have hardware extensions for accelerating virtualization. On some systems this support may be disabled by default in the system’s BIOS/UEFI. To enable the extensions, you might have to go into the system’s BIOS/UEFI setup configuration at boot time. Consult your system’s hardware documentation for more information.


### Install KVM and libvirt tools

Install the KVM and virtualization tools for your Linux system. Then, start `libvirtd`.


#### Fedora 23

[.code-block]
```
$ su -
# dnf install @virtualization
# systemctl enable libvirtd
# systemctl start libvirtd
```

Check that libvirtd is running:

`# systemctl status libvirtd`

Optionally, add your user id to the `libvirtd` group to enable running KVM virtualization without being prompted for a passowrd. If `$USER` doesn't contain your username, enter your username instead:

[.code-block]
```
# echo $USER
# usermod -a -G libvirt $USER
```

Note: you will need to log out and back in again for the group change to take affect.


#### CentOS 7

[.code-block]
```
$ su -
# yum install @virtualization
# systemctl enable libvirtd
# systemctl start libvirtd
```

Check that libvirtd is running:

`# systemctl status libvirtd`

Optionally, add your user id to the `libvirtd` groups to enable running KVM virtualization without being prompted for a password. If `$USER` doesn't contain your username, enter your username instead:

[.code-block]
```
# echo $USER
# usermod -a -G libvirt $USER
```

Note: you will need to log out and back in again for the group change to take affect.


#### Ubuntu 14.04

[.code-block]
```
$ sudo -i
# apt-get install qemu-kvm bridge-utils libvirt-bin virt-manager virtinst virt-viewer
```

Check that libvirtd is running:

`# /etc/init.d/libvirt-bin status`

Optionally, add your user id to the `libvirtd` group to enable running KVM virtualization as a non-root user. If `$USER` doesn't contain your username, enter your username instead:

[.code-block]
```
# echo $USER
# usermod -a -G libvirt $USER 
```

Note: you will need to log out and back in again for the group change to take affect.


### Create and configure a VM

In this step you will create and configure the VM that will run Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The physical system you are running KVM/libvirt on is called the _host system_. The VM is called the _guest system_.

Instructions are provided for creating the VM using the `virt-manager` or from the command line using `virt-install`.

#### Using `virt-install` (command line)

Use the following command to create a VM and start installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 

Fedora 23 and CentOS 7:

Note: you need to run `virt-install` as the root user.

[.code-block]
```
# virt-install --name rhel --ram 2048 --disk size=20,format=qcow2 --vcpus 2 \
       --cdrom rhel-server-7.2_x86-64-dvd.iso \
       --virt-type kvm --os-variant rhel7 --graphics spice
```

Ubuntu 14.04:

[.code-block]
```
$ virt-install --name rhel --ram 2048 --disk size=20,path=$HOME/rhelvm.sda --vcpus 2 \
       --cdrom rhel-server-7.2_x86-64-dvd.iso \
       --virt-type kvm --os-variant rhel7
```


After creating the VM, `virt-install` will automatically start `virt-viewer` to give you access to the VM's console. Proceed to <<kvm-boot-install, Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux>>.


#### Using the `virt-manager` GUI

To create a VM using the `virt-manager` GUI, start _Virtual Machine Manager_ from the system menu or enter the command `virt-manager`.

. When `virt-manager` opens, it will show the available hypervisor connections. If you don't see _QEMU/KVM_ listed:
.. Select _New Connection_ from the _File_ menu.

### Installation instructions

A few notes about working with `virt-manager` or `virt-viewer`

* When you click inside the VM window, the mouse pointer and keyboard will be captured by the VM until you release them by hitting the left _Ctrl_ and _Alt_ keys at the same time.
* After the installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux completes, the integration the of mouse pointer will be improved. You will no longer need to hit the left _Ctrl_ and _Alt_ keys to move the focus outside of the VM window.
* Tools for libvirt such as `virt-manager` and `virt-viewer` can work with VMs running on the local machine as well as remote systems. You may need to specify which hypervisor to connect to, _QEMU/KVM_ in the `virt-manager` GUI, or `-c qemu:///session` for command line line tools such as `virt-viewer`.

## Step2 Virtualbox Content

This step provides an overview of the key steps for installing #{site.base_url}/products/rhel/overview/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server] in a https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox, window='_blank'] Virtual Machine (VM) so you can get started with software development. The VM you create will give you a Red Hat Enterprise Linux development environment that you can use on your system running Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Ubuntu, or other Linux.

### Overview of steps

. Download and install VirtualBox.
. Configure a VM to run Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
. Boot the VM using the ISO file you downloaded in step 1 as a virtual DVD.
. Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Note: This tutorial does not replace the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation Guide, window='_blank'] or https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html[VirtualBox User Manual, window='_blank']. Instead, this tutorial provides an overview of the key steps for software developers. For detailed instructions, see the respective manual.

A few things to keep in mind:

* You will be using the Server edition of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This provides you with the widest range of software to develop and test with.
* The VM will have a full graphical desktop. You will select _Server with a GUI_ during installation.
* After installation, you will configure additional software repositories that will provide you access to optional development software such as RHSCL and DTS.

### System Requirements

The requirements for your physical system that will host the Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM are:

* a 64-bit x86 machine with hardware virtualization assistance (Intel VT-X or AMD-V).
* An https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#hostossupport[operating system supported by VirtualBox, window='_blank'] such as Microsoft Windows 7 or later, Apple Mac OS X 10.8 or later, Ubuntu Linux 12.04 or later.
* 4 GB RAM (8 GB preferred).
* 24 GB of available disk space for the VM, the installation ISO file, and VirtualBox.

If you encounter difficulties at any point in this tutorial, see <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>>.


### Download and install VirtualBox

This guide uses VirtualBox is 5.0.x. You may also use VirtualBox 4.3.x though there will be some minor differences from what is described here. Older versions of VirtualBox may work but have not been tested.

#### Microsoft Windows or Apple Mac OS X

Go to the https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox Download page, window='_blank'] and download the installer for your system. After the download completes, click on the downloaded `.exe` or `.dmg` file to start the installation. During the installation you will need to agree to using administrative privileges for a number of the steps.

#### Ubuntu Linux and other Linux systems

Ubuntu Linux and other Linux distributions includes packages for VirtualBox that you can install using your regular package management commands. On Ubuntu Linux use the following command:

`$ sudo apt-get install virtualbox`

If your distribution doesn’t include VirtualBox packages or the packages are older than VirtualBox 4.3.x, see the VirtualBox for Linux download page to download a package for your system.

#### Optional step: Install VirtualBox Extension Pack

A extension package is available for VirtualBox that provides support for USB devices, remote desktop access via RDP, and PXE boot. The software is provided in binary form as it is not open-source. The extension package is available on the https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox Download page, window='_blank'].

#### Enable Intel VT-x or AMD-V Virtualization in BIOS/UEFI

Intel and AMD processors have hardware extensions for accelerating virtualization. On some systems this support may be disabled by default in the system’s BIOS/UEFI. To enable the extensions, you might have to go into the system’s BIOS/UEFI setup configuration at boot time. Consult your system’s hardware documentation for more information.

#### Disable Microsoft Hyper-V to avoid conflicts with VirtualBox

On some Microsoft Windows systems it may be necessary to disable Microsoft Hyper-V virtualization in order to use VirtualBox. Only one virtualization platform, or hypervisor, can be active on a host system at a time. While hypervisors like VirtualBox only take control of the host system’s hardware virtualization capabilities when they are actually running a VM, Microsoft Hyper-V takes control at boot time. In order to use VirtualBox, Hyper-V must either be disabled or uninstalled. Consult Microsoft’s documentation for more information. Note: if you are interested in using Microsoft Hyper-V instead of VirtualBox, follow the steps in the Hyper-V tab at the top of this page.

### Create and configure a VM in VirtualBox

In this step you will create and configure the VM that will run Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The system you are running VirtualBox on is called the _host system_. Note: VirtualBox refers to the VM running Red Hat Enterprise Linux as the _guest system_. However, most of the options to control the VM are under the _Machine_ menu entry.

First, launch VirtualBox from your system’s menu. On some systems, the menu entry will be called _Oracle VM VirtualBox_.

Before you create any VMs, you may wish to change where VirtualBox stores the files that are used as virtual hard disks for the VMs you create. By default, VirtualBox places these files in your home directory. You will need at least 20 GB of available space. To change the location, select _Preferences_ from the _File_ menu. Under _General_, change _Default Machine Folder_ to your preferred location.

Click the _New_ button to create a new VM. A series of dialog boxes will come up for you to configure the VM:

. On the _Create Virtual Machine_ dialog:
.. Enter _RHEL_ as the name or part of the name. This will be the name of the created VM in VirtualBox. Including _RHEL_ will automatically set VM _Type_ and _Version_.
.. Ensure that _Type_ is set to _Linux_ and _Version_ is set to _Red Hat (64-bit)_.
.. Click _Next_.
+
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/vbox/win-vbox-02-create.png')}[Screenshot VirtualBox VM Create]
+
. Set the VM memory size to at least _2048 MB_ on the _Memory size_ dialog. This value can be changed later. The minimum you should use is 2048 MB, however 4096 MB is suggested. Then, click _Next_.
. Next you will configure the new VM's virtual hard disk. The size of the virtual hard disk, should be a minimum of 20 GB. While this setting can be changed later, it is a multi-step process not covered by this guide. Therefore it is recommended that you size the virtual hard disk to be large enough for your software development activities. Note: The space on your host system's physical disk will not be allocated until it is used by the VM. Complete the next set of dialog boxes to configure the virtual hard disk:
.. Select _Create a virtual hard disk now_ on the _Hard disk_ dialog. Then, click _Create_ to move to the next dialog.
.. Select _VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)_ on the _Hard disk file type_ dialog. Then, click _Next_.
.. Select _Dynamically allocated_ on the _Storage on physical hard disk_ dialog. Then, click _Next_.
+
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/vbox/win-vbox-05-hd4.png')}[Screenshot HD Dynamic]
.. On the _File location and size_ dialog:
... Change the _name_ and _location_ if desired.
... Set the _size_ to be a minimum of _20 GB_.
... Click _Create_.
+
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/vbox/win-vbox-05-hd2.png')}[Screenshot File Location]

At this point the basic VM has been created, however additional configuration is necessary. Click to select the new VM so that it is highlighted, then click the Settings button. Make the following changes:

image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/vbox/win-vbox-06-settings1.png')}[Screenshot VM Created]

. Select the _General_ group, then click the _Advanced_ tab. Enable copy-and-paste between the host system and the VM by setting _Shared Clipboard_ and _Drag’n’Drop_ to _Bidirectional_. Note: copy-and-paste will only be available after VirtualBox Guest Additions are installed on the VM during step 3.
+
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/vbox/win-vbox-06-settings2.png')}[Screenshot Settings Advanced]
+
. By default, the VM will have a single virtual processor. If your system has multiple processors or cores, you can add more. Select the _System_ group, then click the _Processor_ tab. Adjust _Processors_ to the desired value.
+
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/vbox/win-vbox-06-settings3.png')}[Screenshot Settings Processor]
+
. In the _Network_ group, under the _Adapter 1_ tab, you can configure the VM’s networking configuration. The default is Network Address Translation (NAT) which is recommended because it is the easiest to manage. You may want to choose _Bridged_ to attach the VM directly to the physical network. See <<VirtualBox Networking>> below for more information.
+
. Next, configure the VM to use the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server binary DVD ISO file as a virtual CD/DVD:
.. Select the _Storage_ section of the _VM Settings_ dialog.
.. Under _Controller: IDE_, select the CD icon that says _Empty_ next to it.
.. On the right side, under _Attributes_, click the CD icon on the far right.
.. Select _Choose Virtual Optical Disk File_.
.. Navigate to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server binary DVD ISO file that you downloaded earlier.
. Click _OK_ to close the VM settings dialog.
+
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/vbox/win-vbox-06-settings4.png')}[Screenshot Settings RHEL DVD]


#### Create a shared folder between the host system and the VM (Optional)

You may create a folder that is shared between your host system and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM. This makes it easy to share files such as source code between the two systems. The configuration for shared folders can be performed now or anytime later.

Shared folders will only be available on the VM after the _VirtualBox Guest Additions_ software is installed on the VM. Installation of VirtualBox Guest Additions is covered in step 3 with the other Red Hat Enterprise Linux post-installation steps.

To add a shared folder:

. Select your _RHEL_ VM in VirtualBox, the click the _Settings_ button.
. Select the _Shared Folders_ group.
. Click the folder icon with a _+_ in the upper right corner.
. In the _Add Share_ dialog:
.. Enter the path on the host system in the _Folder Path_.
.. Enter a name without spaces for the shared folder on the VM.
. Click _OK_ to close the _VM Settings_ dialog.
+
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/vbox/win-vbox-shared-folder-1.png')}[Screenshot VirtualBox Shared Folder]

The path to shared folders on the VM will be `/media/sf_<foldername>`.

### Boot the VM and install Red Hat Enterprise Linux

This section provides a brief overview of the steps for installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Detailed instructions can be found in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation Guide, window='_blank'].

There are a few key steps to remember during the installation process:

. The _Installation destination_ will be the virtual hard disk you created for the VM.
. You should configure networking under _Network and host name_ before starting the installation. You will need access to the Internet to complete registration and download additional software. The network can be configured after the system is installed. However, the steps are more straightforward during installation.
. Select _Server with a GUI_ under _Software Selection_ so the system will boot into the full graphical environment after installation. By default, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server will not install a graphical desktop.
. Create your primary user account during installation: After the installation begins, you will be instructed to set a password for the root account and be given the opportunity to create a regular user account. You should create a user before the installation process completes. The regular user will be your primary login for development. The root account should only be used for system administration tasks. If you don't create a user before the installation completes, you will need to reboot and then log in as root to create user accounts.

.. You can change the size of the virtual hard disk by clicking the _Hard Disk_ icon. The size of the virtual hard disk, should be a minimum of 20 GB. While this setting can be changed later, it is a multi-step process not covered by this guide. Therefore it is recommended that you size the virtual hard disk to be large enough for your software development activities. Note: The space on your host system's physical disk will not be allocated until it is used by the VM.
.. Under _Network Adapter_, you can set the VM’s networking configuration. The default is Network Address Translation (NAT) which is recommended as it is the easiest to manage. You may want to choose _Bridged_ to attach the VM directly to the physical network. See <<VMware Networking>> below for more information.

### Boot the VM and install Red Hat Enterprise Linux

To start the VM and begin installation:

. Start VMware if it isn’t already running
. select the _rhel_ VM.
. click the _Play_ button.

The VM should now boot up from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server DVD `.iso` file.

Note: When you click inside the VM window, the keyboard and mouse will be captured by the VM until you hit _Ctrl_ and _Alt_ on Windows or _Ctrl_ and the _Command_ key (&#8984;) on the Mac. When the system is fully installed this will no longer be necessary. See <<Open VM Tools replaces VMware Tools for Linux>>.

This section provides a brief overview of the steps for installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Detailed instructions can be found in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation Guide, window='_blank'].

There are a few key steps to remember during the installation process:

. The _Installation destination_ will be the virtual hard disk you created for the VM.
. You should configure networking under _Network and host name_ before starting the installation. You will need access to the Internet to complete registration and download additional software. The network can be configured after the system is installed. However, the steps are more straightforward during installation.
. Select _Server with a GUI_ under _Software Selection_ so the system will boot into the full graphical environment after installation. By default, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server will not install a graphical desktop.
. Create your primary user account during installation: After the installation begins, you will be instructed to set a password for the root account and be given the opportunity to create a regular user account. You should create a user before the installation process completes. The regular user will be your primary login for development. The root account should only be used for system administration tasks. If you don't create a user before the installation completes, you will need to reboot and then log in as root to create user accounts.

[[kvm-lockscreen]]
### Disable lock screen and screen power saving

For security and to save energy, the default configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux is to lock the screen and turn the screen off when idle. On a VM, it is best to disable these features since the host system will control screen locking and power saving.

To disable these features, from the desktop _Application_ menu, select the _System Tools_ group, then select _Settings_. Follow these steps in the _Settings_ application.

. Click the _Privacy_ icon to bring up the _Privacy_ dialog.
. Click on _Screen Lock_ to bring up the _Screen Lock_ dialog.
. Click on the _On/Off_ switch to the right of _Automatic Screen Lock_.
. Click the _X_ in the upper right hand corner to dismiss the _Screen Lock_ dialog.
. Click the _<_ button in the upper left corner of the _Privacy_ dialog to go back to the main _Settings_ screen.
. Click on the _Power_ icon to open the _Power settings_ dialog.
. Click the menu button to the right of _Blank screen_. Select _Never_ from the list of choices.
. Finally, Click the ‘X’ in the upper right hand corner to close the _Settings_ application.


### Install the latest updates

In this step, you will download and install the latest updates for your system from Red Hat. In the process, you will verify that your system has a current Red Hat subscription and is able to receive updates.

First, start a _Terminal_ window from the _Application_ menu. Then, after using `su` to change to the root user ID, use `subscription-manager` to verify that you have access to Red Hat software repositories.

[.code-block]
```
$ su -
# subscription-manager repos --list-enabled
```

If you don’t see any enabled repositories, your system might not be registered with Red Hat or might not have a valid subscription. See <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>> for more information.

Now download and install any available updates by running `yum update`.

`# yum -y update`

If yum updates the kernel package or installs a large number of updates, you should reboot your system. You can do this from the VM's desktop by clicking the down arrow icon in the upper right corner, then clicking the power icon. Alternatively you can reboot the system from the command line:

`# reboot`


### Enable additional software repositories

In this step you will configure your system to obtain software from the _Optional RPMs_ and _RHSCL_ software repositories. The _Optional RPMs_ repository includes a number of development packages. The RHSCL repository includes the both the RHSCL software collections as well as DTS (the Red Hat Developer Toolset).

[.code-block]
```
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
```


### KVM/libvirt Networking

The default network configuration is for the VM to share the host system’s network connection(s) and IP address using network address translation (NAT). This is the easiest to manage and will be fine for many uses. Using NAT, the VM will be able to access resources on your network or the Internet. However services, such as a web server, running inside the VM won’t be directly accessible from outside of the VM.

Alternatively, you can attach the VM to directly network by sharing the network adapter from the host system as a bridged network adapter. In this configuration, the VM gets its own IP address, usually using your network’s DHCP server. The VM appears on the network the same way a physical computer would with its own hardware MAC address. The host’s network adapter is shared by creating a network bridge. The VM’s virtual network adapter can only be bridged to one physical network adapter at a time. If your system has more than one network adapter you need to choose which one to attach to. If your system switches between wired and wireless connections, you will need to switch bridged adapters for the VM.

Networking, both physical and virtual, is a large topic beyond the scope of this guide. For more information see your system's documentation.

# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
```

### Install VirtualBox Guest Additions

Enhanced VM integration is available by installing VirtualBox Guest Additions on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM. The enhancements include:

* Better mouse pointer integration that eliminates the need to capture the pointer within the VM.
* Copy and paste between the VM and the host system.
* Folders that are shared from the host system to the VM. This can be helpful for making your source code available on the VM.
* Ability to dynamically resize the VM's window which will change the size of the graphical desktop inside the VM.

VirtualBox Guest Additions are packaged as a `.iso` file, which will be used on the VM as a virtual CD. VirtualBox will load the virtual CD when you select _Insert Guest Additions CD image_ from the menu. To install VirtualBox Guest Editions:

* You need to be logged into Red Hat Enterprise Linux with the graphical desktop running.
* You need to have installed _Development Tools_ during installation. The development tools are used to compile the VirtualBox drivers.

The steps to install VirtualBox Guest Additions are:

. Select _Insert Guest Additions CD image_ from the _Devices_ menu of the VM window.
. A dialog box will pop up asking you if you want to run the software on the virtual CD. Click _Run_.
+
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/vbox/win-vga-01-autorun.png')}[Screenshot VirtualBox Guest Additions Auto Run]

. Eject the virtual CD by right clicking on its icon on the desktop and selecting _Eject_.

Note: If you upgrade VirtualBox on your host system, you will need to repeat these steps.


### VirtualBox Networking

The default VirtualBox network configuration is for the VM to share the host system’s network connection(s) and IP address using network address translation (NAT). This is the easiest to manage and will be fine for many uses. Using NAT, the VM will be able to access resources on your network or the Internet. However services, such as a web server, running inside the VM won’t be directly accessible from outside of the VM.

You can make specific services on the VM accessible using port forwarding. For example you can configure port forwarding so that port 8080 on your host system maps to port 80 on the VM.

Alternatively, you can attach the VM to directly network by sharing the network adapter from the host system as a bridged network adapter. In this configuration, the VM gets its own IP address, usually using your network’s DHCP server. The VM appears on the network the same way a physical computer would with its own hardware MAC address. The host’s network adapter is shared by a device driver that is installed by VirtualBox. The VM’s virtual network adapter can only be bridged to one physical network adapter at a time. If your system has more than one network adapter you need to choose which one to attach to. If your system switches between wired and wireless connections, you will need to switch bridged adapters for the VM.

Networking, both physical and virtual, is a large topic beyond the scope of this guide. For more information see https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html[Virtual Networking, window='_blank'] in the https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/[VirtualBox User Manual, window='_blank'].

[[vmware-lockscreen]]
### Disable lock screen and screen power saving

For security and to save energy, the default configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux is to lock the screen and turn the screen off when idle. On a VM, it is best to disable these features since the host system will control screen locking and power saving.

To disable these features, from the desktop _Application_ menu, select the _System Tools_ group, then select _Settings_. Follow these steps in the _Settings_ application.

. Click the _Privacy_ icon to bring up the _Privacy_ dialog.
. Click on _Screen Lock_ to bring up the _Screen Lock_ dialog.
. Click on the _On/Off_ switch to the right of _Automatic Screen Lock_.
. Click the _X_ in the upper right hand corner to dismiss the _Screen Lock_ dialog.
. Click the _<_ button in the upper left corner of the _Privacy_ dialog to go back to the main _Settings_ screen.
. Click on the _Power_ icon to open the _Power settings_ dialog.
. Click the menu button to the right of _Blank screen_. Select _Never_ from the list of choices.
. Finally, Click the ‘X’ in the upper right hand corner to close the _Settings_ application.


### Install the latest updates

In this step, you will download and install the latest updates for your system from Red Hat. In the process, you will verify that your system has a current Red Hat subscription and is able to receive updates.

First, start a _Terminal_ window from the _Application_ menu. Then, after using `su` to change to the root user ID, use `subscription-manager` to verify that you have access to Red Hat software repositories.

[.code-block]
```
$ su -
# subscription-manager repos --list-enabled
```

If you don’t see any enabled repositories, your system might not be registered with Red Hat or might not have a valid subscription. See <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>> for more information.

Now download and install any available updates by running `yum update`.

`# yum -y update`

If yum updates the kernel package or installs a large number of updates, you should reboot your system. You can do this from the VM's desktop by clicking the down arrow icon in the upper right corner, then clicking the power icon. Alternatively you can reboot the system from the command line:

`# reboot`


### Enable additional software repositories

In this step you will configure your system to obtain software from the _Optional RPMs_ and _RHSCL_ software repositories. The _Optional RPMs_ repository includes a number of development packages. The RHSCL repository includes the both the RHSCL software collections as well as DTS (the Red Hat Developer Toolset).

[.code-block]
```
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
```

Finally, reboot the VM. You can do this from the VM's desktop by clicking the down arrow icon in the upper right corner, then clicking the power icon. Alternatively you can reboot the system from the command line:

`# reboot`


### VMware Networking

The default VMware network configuration is for the VM to share the host system’s network connection(s) and IP address using network address translation (NAT). This is the easiest to manage and will be fine for many uses. Using NAT, the VM will be able to access resources on your network or the Internet. However services, such as a web server, running inside the VM won’t be directly accessible from outside of the VM.

Alternatively, you can attach the VM to directly network by sharing the network adapter from the host system as a bridged network adapter. In this configuration, the VM gets its own IP address, usually using your network’s DHCP server. The VM appears on the network the same way a physical computer would with its own hardware MAC address. The host’s network adapter is shared by a device driver that is installed by VMware. The VM’s virtual network adapter can only be bridged to one physical network adapter at a time. If your system has more than one network adapter you need to choose which one to attach to. If your system switches between wired and wireless connections, you will need to switch bridged adapters for the VM.

Networking, both physical and virtual, is a large topic beyond the scope of this guide. For more information see http://blogs.vmware.com/kb/2013/03/networking-options-in-vmware-workstation-and-fusion.html[Networking options in VMware Workstation and Fusion, window='_blank'] or the networking section of the https://pubs.vmware.com/workstation-12/index.jsp#com.vmware.ws.using.doc/GUID-0CE1AE01-7E79-41BB-9EA8-4F839BE40E1A.html[VMware Workstation User's Guide, window='_blank'].


### Open VM Tools replaces VMware Tools for Linux

Red Hat Enterprise Linux includes Open VM Tools which replaces the VMware's Operating System Specific Tools (OST), also known as VMware Tools for Linux. You do not need to install VMware Tools as the functionality is implemented in the open source packages that are included with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. These tools are services and drivers that are installed in the guest operating system under the VM to:

* Enable copy-and-paste between the host system and the VM.
* Provide better mouse pointer integration.
* Allow resizing of the VM window which will change the size of VM's graphical desktop.
* Improve VM performance.

Open VM Tools does not currently include the driver that is needed for shared folders. To enable shared folders you need to run the VMware Tools installer.


### Enable VMware shared folders

You may create a folder that is shared between your host system and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM. This makes it easy to share files such as source code between the two systems. Enabling VMware shared folders requires installing the VMware Host Guest File System (VMHGFS) driver on the VM. The VMHGFS driver is included with VMware Tools. By default, the VMware Tools installer will install the VMHGFS driver and leave the existing installation of Open VM Tools intact. This is the suggested configuration for enabling shared folders.


To install VMHGFS:

. VMware Tools are packaged as a `.iso` file, which will be used on the VM as a virtual CD. VMware will load the virtual CD when you select _Install VMware Tools_.
+
For VMware Player on Windows, select _Manage_ from the _Player_ menu. Then select _Install VMware Tools_.
+
For VMware Fusion on Mac OS, select _Install VMware Tools_ from the _Virtual Machine_ menu. Then click _Install_ on the pop-up.
+
. Dismiss the _Open with Files_ pop-up on the VM by clicking the _X_.
. If VMware adds a message at the bottom of the VM window, dismiss it by clicking on the _X_.
. Open a _Terminal_ window in the VM from the _Applications_ menu.
. Change to the root user with `su -`. You will need to enter the root password.
. Enter the following commands:

```
# mkdir /mnt/cd
# mount -o ro /dev/sr0 /mnt/cd
# cd /tmp
# mkdir vmware-tools
# cd vmware-tools
# ls /mnt/cd/*.tar.gz
```

In the directory listing, make a note of the exact file name of the `.tar.gz` file to use in the next command as the version number may have changed.

```
# tar xvzf /mnt/cd/VMwareTools-10.0.5-3228253.tar.gz
```

Enter the follow command to start the VMware Tools installer:

```
# cd vmware-tools-distrib
# ./vmware-install.pl
```

The installer will ask a series of questions. Accept all the default choices by hitting the return key *with the exception* of _Would you like to enable VMware automatic kernel modules?_. Answer _yes_ to enable automatic kernel modules.

When the installer is finished, eject the virtual CD:

```
# eject
```


#### Create a shared folder mapping (Microsoft Windows)

. From the _Player_ menu, select _Manage_, then select _Virtual Machine Settings_.
. Select the _Options_ tab on the left from the _VM Settings_ dialog.
. Select _Shared Folders_ in the list on the left.
. Select _Always Enabled_ under _Folder Sharing_ on the right.
. Click the _Add_ button.
. On the _Add Shared Folder Wizard_, click _Next_.
. Click _Browse_ and navigate to the folder you wish to share.
. Enter the name for the shared folder on VM. Do not use spaces.
. Click _Next_.
. On the _Specify Shared Folder Attributes:
.. Make sure _Enable this share_ is checked.
.. Optionally, check _Read-only_ if you want to prevent the VM from being able to modify the shared folder.
.. Click _Finish_.
. Click _OK_ to close the _Virtual Machine Settings_ dialog.

On the VM the path to the shared folders will be `/mnt/hgfs/<folder name>`.

#### Create a shared folder mapping (Mac OS X)

. Click the _Settings (Wrench icon)_ button.
. Click the _Sharing_ icon under _System Settings_.
. On the _Sharing_ dialog:
.. Make sure _Enabled Shared Folders_ is checked.
.. Click the _+_ button.
.. Navigate to the folder you wish to share.
.. Click _Add_.
. Optionally, change the name of the shared folder by clicking in the _Name_ column. Do not use spaces in the name.
. If you want to prevent the VM from modifying the folder, select _Read Only_ in the _Permissions_ column.
. Close the _Sharing_ dialog.

On the VM the path to the shared folders will be `/mnt/hgfs/<folder name>`.
