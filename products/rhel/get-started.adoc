## Step2 Baremetal Content

This section provides a brief overview of the steps for installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Detailed instructions can be found in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation Guide].

There are a few key steps to remember during the installation process:

. You will need to select an _Installation destination_, which is the disk or partition(s) where the software will be installed. *The disk or partition(s) you select will be overwritten.* Make sure you understand your selection before starting the installation to avoid accidental data loss.
. You should configure networking under _Network and host name_ before starting the installation. You will need access to the Internet to complete registration and download additional software. The network can be configured after the system is installed. However, the steps are more straightforward during installation.
. Select _Server with a GUI_ under _Software Selection_ so the system will boot into the full graphical environment after installation. By default, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server will not install a graphical desktop.
. Create your primary user account during installation: After the installation begins, you will be instructed to set a password for the root account and be given the opportunity to create a regular user account. You should create a user before the installation process completes. The regular user will be your primary login for development. The root account should only be used for system administration tasks. If you don't create a user before the installation completes, you will need to reboot and then log in as root to create user accounts.

## Step2 Hyperv Content

*Step Two Hyper-V Content will go here*

## Step2 Virtualbox Content

This step provides an overview of the key steps for installing link:http://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/overview/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server] in a link:https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] Virtual Machine (VM) so you can get started with software development. The VM you create will give you a Red Hat Enterprise Linux development environment that you can use on your system running Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Ubuntu, or other Linux.

### Overview of steps

. Download and install VirtualBox.
. Configure a VM to run Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
. Boot the VM using the ISO file you downloaded in step 1 as a virtual DVD.
. Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Note: This tutorial does not replace the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation Guide] or link:https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html[VirtualBox User Manual]. Instead, this tutorial provides an overview of the key steps for software developers. For detailed instructions, see the respective manaul.

A few things to keep in mind:

* You will be using the Server edition of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This provides you with the widest range of software to develop and test with.
* The VM will have a full graphical desktop. You will select _Server with a GUI_ during installation.
* After installation, you will configure additional software repositories that will provide you access to optional development software such as RHSCL and DTS.

### System Requirements

The requirements for your physical system that will host the Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM are:

* a 64-bit x86 machine with hardware virtualization assistance (Intel VT-X or AMD-V).
* An link:https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#hostossupport[operating system supported by VirtualBox] such as Microsoft Windows 7 or later, Apple Mac OS X 10.8 or later, Ubuntu Linux 12.04 or later.
* 4 GB RAM (8 GB preferred).
* 24 GB of available disk space for the VM, the installation ISO file, and VirtualBox.
* A processor with hardware virtualization assistance (Intel VT-x or AMD-V).


If you encounter difficulties at any point in this tutorial, see <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>>.


### Download and install VirtualBox

This guide uses VirtualBox is 5.0.x. You may also use VirtualBox 4.3.x though there will be some minor differences from what is described here. Older versions of VirtualBox may work but have not been tested.

#### Microsoft Windows or Apple Mac OS X

Go to the link:https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox Download page] and download the installer for your system. After the download completes, click on the downloaded `.exe` or `.dmg` file to start the installation. During the installation you will need to agree to using administrative privileges for a number of the steps.

#### Ubuntu Linux and other Linux systems

Ubuntu Linux and other Linux distributions includes packages for VirtualBox that you can install using your regular package management commands. On Ubuntu Linux use the following command:

`$ sudo apt-get install virtualbox`

If your distribution doesn’t include VirtualBox packages or the packages are older than VirtualBox 4.3.x, see the VirtualBox for Linux download page to download a package for your system.

#### Optional step: Install VirtualBox Extension Pack

A extension package is available for VirtualBox that provides support for USB devices, remote desktop access via RDP, and PXE boot. The software is provided in binary form as it is not open-source. The extension package is available on the link:https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox Download page]. 

#### Enable Intel VT-x or AMD-V Virtualizatoin in BIOS/UEFI

Intel and AMD processors have hardware extensions for accelerating virtualization. On some systems this support may be disabled by default in the system’s BIOS/UEFI.  To enable the extensions, you might have to go into the system’s BIOS/UEFI setup configuration at boot time. Consult your system’s hardware documentation for more information.

#### Disable Microsoft Hyper-V to avoid conflicts with VirtualBox

On some Microsoft Windows systems it may be necessary to disable Microsoft Hyper-V virtualization in order to use VirtualBox. Only one virtualization platform, or hypervisor, can be active on a host system at a time. While hypervisors like VirtualBox only take control of the host system’s hardware virtualization capabilities when they are actually running a VM, Microsoft Hyper-V takes control at boot time. In order to use VirtualBox, Hyper-V must either be disabled or uninstalled. Consult Microsoft’s  documentation for more information. Note: if you are interested in using Microsoft Hyper-V instead of VirtualBox, check the link:http://developers.redhat.com/[Red Hat Developers site] for more information. 

#### Create and configure a VM in VirtualBox

In this step you will create and configure the VM that will run Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The system you are running VirtualBox on is called the _host system_. Note: VirtualBox refers to the VM running Red Hat Enterprise Linux as the _guest system_. However, most of the options to control the VM are under the _Machine_ menu entry.

First, launch VirtualBox from your system’s menu. On some systems, the menu entry will be called _Oracle VM VirtualBox_.

Before you create any VMs, you may wish to change where VirtualBox stores the files that are used as virtual hard disks for the VMs you create. By default, VirtualBox places these files in your home directory. You will need at least 16 GB of available space. To change the location, select _Preferences_ from the _File_ menu. Under _General_, change _Default Machine Folder_ to your preferred location.

Click the _New_ button to create a new VM. A series of dialog boxes will come up for you to configure the VM:

. On the _Create Virtual Machine_ dialog:
.. Enter _RHEL_ as the name or part of the name. This will be the name of the created VM in VirtualBox. Including _RHEL_ will automatically set VM  _Type_ and _Version_.
.. Ensure that _Type_ is set to _Linux_ and _Version_ is set to _Red Hat (64-bit)_.
.. Click _Next_.
+
[.content-img]
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/vbox/ubuntu-vbox-02-create.png')}[Screenshot Boot Splash]
+
. Set the VM memory size ro _4096 MB_ on the _Memory size_ dialog. This value can be changed later. Then, cloick _Next_.


Next you will configure the new VM's virtual hard disk. The size of the virtual hard disk, should be a minimum of 16 GB. While this setting can be changed later, it is a multi-step process not covered by this guide. Therefore it is recommended that you size the virtual hard disk to be large enough for your software development activities. Note: The space on your host system's physical disk will not be allocated until it is used by the VM. Complete the next set of dialogs to configure the virtual hard disk:

. Select _Create a virtual hard disk now_ on the _Hard disk_ dialog. Then, click _Create_ to move to the next dialog.
. Select _VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)_ on the _Hard disk file type_ dialog. Then, click _Next_.
. Select _Dynamically allocated_ on the _Storage on physical hard disk_ dialog. Then, click _Next_.
+
[.content-img]
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/vbox/ubuntu-vbox-05-hd4.png')}[Screenshot HD Dynamic]
. On the _File location and size+ dialog:
.. Change the _name_ and _location_ if desired.
.. Set the _size_ to be a minimum of _16 GB_.
.. Click _Create_.
+
[.content-img]
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/vbox/ubuntu-vbox-05-hd2.png')}[Screenshot File Location]


At this point the basic VM configuration has been completed, however additional configuration is necessary. Click to select the new VM so that it is highlighted, then click the Settings button. Make the following changes:
[.content-img]
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/vbox/ubuntu-vbox-06-settings1.png')}[Screenshot VM Created]

. Select the _General_ group, then click the _Advanced_ tab. Enable copy-and-paste between the host system and the VM by setting _Shared Clipboard_ and _Drag’n’Drop_ to _Bidirectional_.
+
[.content-img]
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/vbox/ubuntu-vbox-06-settings2.png')}[Screenshot Settings Advanced]
+
. By default, the VM will have a single virtual processor. If your system has multiple processors or cores, you can add more. Select the _System_ group, then click the _Processor_ tab. Adjust _Processors_ to the desired value.
+
[.content-img]
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/vbox/ubuntu-vbox-06-settings3.png')}[Screenshot Settings Processor]
+
. In the _Network_ group, under the _Adapter 1_ tab, you can configure the VM’s networking configuration. See _VirtualBox Networking_ below for more information.

Next, configure the VM to use the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server binary DVD ISO file as a virtual CD/DVD:

. Select the _Storage_ section of the _VM Settings_ dialog.
. Under _Controller: IDE_, select the CD icon that says _Empty_ next to it.
. On the right side, under _Attributes_, click the CD icon on the far right. 
. Select _Choose Virtual Optical Disk File_.
. Navigate to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server binary DVD ISO file that you downloaded earlier.
. Click _OK_ to close the VM settings dialog.

[.content-img]
image:#{cdn(site.base_url + '/images/products/rhel/rhel7-install/vbox/ubuntu-vbox-06-settings4.png')}[Screenshot Settings RHEL DVD]


#### Create a shared folder between the host system and the VM (Optional)

You may create a folder that is shared between your host system and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM. This makes it easy to share files such as source code between the two systems. The configuration for shared folders can be performed now or anytime later.

Shared folders will only be available on the VM after the _VirtualBox Guest Additions_ software is installed on the VM. Installation of VirtualBox Guest Additions is covered later with the other Red Hat Enterprise Linux post-installation steps.

To add a shared folder:

. Select your _RHEL VM_ in VirtualBox, the click the _Settings_ button.
. Select the _Shared Folders_ group.
. Click the folder icon with a _+_ in the upper right corner.
. In the _Add Share_ dialog:
.. Enter the path on the host system in the _Folder Path_.
.. Ehter a name without spaces for the shared folder on the VM.
. Click _OK_ to close the _VM Settings_ dialog.


### Boot the VM and install Red Hat Enterprise Linux

To start the VM and begin installation, start VirtualBox if it isn’t already running, then select your VM and click the Start button. The VM should now boot up from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server DVD.

This section provides a brief overview of the steps for installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Detailed instructions can be found in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation Guide].

There are a few key steps to remember during the installation process:

. The _Installation destination_ will be the virtual hard disk you created for the VM.
. You should configure networking under _Network and host name_ before starting the installation. You will need access to the Internet to complete registration and download additional software. The network can be configured after the system is installed. However, the steps are more straightforward during installation.
. Select _Server with a GUI_ under _Software Selection_ so the system will boot into the full graphical environment after installation. By default, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server will not install a graphical desktop.

### VirtualBox Networking

The default VirtualBox network configuration is for the VM to share the host system’s network connection(s) and IP address using network address translation (NAT). This is the easiest to manage and will be fine for many uses. Using NAT, the VM will be able to access resources on your network or the Internet. However services, such as a web server, running inside the VM won’t be directly accessible from outside of the VM.

You can make specific services on the VM accessible using port forwarding. For example you can configure port forwarding so that port 8080 on your host system maps to port 80 on the VM.

Alternatively, you can attach the VM to directly network by sharing the network adapter from the host system as a bridged network adapter. In this configuration, the VM gets its own IP address, usually using your network’s DHCP server. The VM appears on the network the same way a physical computer would with its own hardware MAC address. The host’s network adapter is shared by a device driver that is installed by VirtualBox. The VM’s virtual network adapter can only be bridged to one physical network adapter at a time. If your system has more than one network adapter you need to choose which one to attach to. If your system switches between wired and wireless connections, you will need to switch bridged adapters for the VM.

Networking, both physical and virtual, is a large topic beyond the scope of this guide. For more information see link:https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html[Virtual Networking] in the link:https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/[VirtualBox User Manual].

. I've got a text-based login screen, how do I get a graphical one?
+
During installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server, selecting the _Server with a GUI_ software option will install a full graphical desktop and configure it to start at boot time. You can install the graphical desktop with `yum install` after registering your system with Red Hat. Log in to the system as the `root` user, then use the following commands:
+
[.code-block]
```
# yum groupinstall 'Server with GUI'
# yum install @gnome-desktop @x11 @internet-browser
```
When complete, type `systemctl reboot` to reboot your system.  When the system restarts, you should see a graphical login screen.

. How do I install the C/{cpp} compiler?
+
During installation, selecting the _Development tools_ software option installs the C/{cpp} compiler GCC/pass:[G++] and other related development tools. You can install these tools with `yum install` after registering your system with Red Hat. Log in to the system as the `root` user then use the following command:
+
[.code-block]
```
# yum install @development
```
. I didn't configure a network connection during installation, how do I this on a running system?
+
Registration fails with the message that _subscription.rhn.redhat.com is unreachable_, how do I resolve this?
+
If you did not configure a network connection during installation or the configuration was unsuccessful, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Networking_Guide/index.html[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Networking Guide] for information on configuring networking using either graphical or command-line tools.

. How do I register my system after installation?
+
Use Red Hat Subscription Manager, which can be started from the system menu as a graphical tool, or from the command line using the following command:
+
`# subscription-manager register --auto-attach`
+
