Get started developing with Python on Red Hat Enterprise Linux in under 10 minutes.

## Prerequisites section title
Introduction and Prerequisites

## Prerequisites section
In this tutorial, you will see how to get started with Python 2.7 development on Red Hat Enterprise Linux by creating a simple Hello World application. The tutorial should take 5 to 10 minutes to complete.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Python 2.7 is installed by default. You can skip directly to <<Hello Word and your first application>>, or continue reading to learn more about installing and maintaining software packages.

You will need a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 system with a current Red Hat subscription that allows you to download software and updates from Red Hat. If you don’t have a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, you can try it for free. Get started with an evaluation at link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation[].  Developers should select the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Workstation option to ensure your evaluation includes Red Hat Software Collections and the Red Hat Developer Toolset.

If you have problems at any point, see <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>>.

## Step1 Content

In this step, you will download and install the latest updates from Red Hat for your system. In the process, you will verify that your system has a current Red Hat subscription and is able to receive updates.

First, start a _Terminal_ window from the _Application_ menu.  Then after using `su` to change to the root user ID, use `subscription-manager` to verify that you have access to Red Hat Software Repositories.

[.code-block]
```
$ su -
# subscription-manager repos --list-enabled
```

If you don’t see any enabled repositories, your system might not be registered with Red Hat or might not have a valid subscription. See <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>> for more information.

Now download and install any available updates by running `yum update`.  If updates are available, `yum` will list them and ask if it is OK to proceed.

`# yum update`


## Step2 Content

Python 2.7 and a number of popular Python modules are installed by default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. To see what Python packages are already installed, run the following `yum` command after becoming root with `su`. If you don't already have a _Terminal_ window open, start one from the _Applications_ menu.

[.code-block]
```
$ su -
# yum list installed python\*
```

If Python wasn't installed or needed an update, you would only need to run one `yum` command.

`# yum install python`

To see what other Python modules are included with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, run this command:

`# yum list available python\*`

You are now done with the part that requires root privileges. Type `exit` to return to your normal user ID.

[.code-block]
```
# exit
$
```

If you need help, see <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>>.


## Step3 Content

In this step, you will first run Python in interactive mode.  Then you will create a Python application that can be run from the command line. If you don't have a _Terminal_ window open, start it from the _Applications_ menu.  You should run under your normal user ID,  If you are still running as root, type `exit`.

[.code-block]
```
$ python
Python 2.7.5 (default, Apr  9 2015, 11:03:32)
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Hello, Red Hat Developers World")
Hello, Red Hat Developers World
>>> quit()
```

The next step is to create a Python application that can be run from the command line. Using your preferred text editor, create a file named `hello.py`:

`$ nano hello.py`

Add the following text to the file:
[.code-block]
```
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys

version = "Python %d.%d" % (sys.version_info.major, sys.version_info.minor)
print "Hello, Red Hat Developers World from",version
```

Save it and exit the editor. Then make the script executable and run it:
[.code-block]
```
$ chmod +x hello.py
$ ./hello.py
Hello, Red Hat Developers World from Python 2.7
```

[[troubleshooting]]Troubleshooting and FAQ

## Faq section
1. My system is unable to download updates from Red Hat.
+
I don't have a current Red Hat subscription, can I get an evaluation?
+
If you don’t have a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, you can try it for free. Get started with an evaluation at link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation[].  Developers should select the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Workstation option to ensure your evaluation includes additional tools from the Red Hat Developer Toolset and Red Hat Software Collections.
+
2. Some Python code/examples I’ve tried don’t work with Python 2 from Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
+
Python 3.x is a new version of the Python language that is incompatible with the previous 2.x series. The version of Python included with Red Hat Enterprise Linux in `/usr/bin/python` is from the Python 2.x series. There is a large amount of code written for Python 2.x that will not run without modification on Python 3.x. Likewise, code that is written for Python 3 is incompatible with Python 2.
+
For more information see link:https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3[“Should I use Python 2 or Python 3 for my development activity?”] at link:https://python.org[Python.org]
+
3. How can I get Python 3 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux?
+
Python 3 is available through link:https://access.redhat.com/products/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/Developer/#dev-page=5[Red Hat Software Collections], which delivers the latest stable versions of dynamic languages, open source databases, and web development tools that can be deployed alongside those included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
