Introduction and Prerequisites

## Prerequisites section
In this tutorial, you will learn how to start building {tthw-langlong} applications in docker containers on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. In order to build and run containers you will first install `docker` on your Red Hat Enterprise Linux {tthw-rhelver} system. You will use the {tthw-langlong} container image from Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) 2.2 as the basis for your containerized application.

You will need a system running Red Hat Enterprise Linux {tthw-rhelver} Server with a current Red Hat subscription that allows you to download software and updates from Red Hat. Developers can now get a no-cost Red Hat Enterprise LinuxÂ® Developer Suite subscription for development purposes by link:#{site.download_manager_base_url}/download-manager/link/1350474[registering and downloading] through link:#{site.base_url}/[developers.redhat.com].

## Step1 Content

In this step, you will configure your system to build and run docker containers. In the process, you will add the necessary software repositories, then verify that your system has a current Red Hat subscription and is able to receive updates from Red Hat. Your system needs to be already registered with Red Hat.

First, you will enable two Red Hat software repositories that are disabled by default. Instructions are provided for both the command line (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI).

### Using the Red Hat Subscription Manager GUI

Red Hat Subscription Manager can be started from the _System Tools_ group of the _Applications_ menu. Alternatively, you can start it from the command prompt by typing `subscription-manager-gui`.

Select _Repositories_ from the _System_ menu of the subscription manager. In the list of repositories, check the _Enabled_ column for _rhel-7-server-optional-rpms_ and _rhel-7-server-extras-rpms_. After clicking, it might take several seconds for the check mark to appear in the enabled column.

### Using subscription-manager from the command line

You can add or remove software repositories from the command line using the `subscription-manager` tool. Start a _Terminal_ window if you don't already have one open. Use `su` to become the root user.  Use `subscription-manager --list` option to to view the available software repositories.

[listing,subs="attributes"]
----
$ su -
# subscription-manager repos --list
----

Enable the two additional repositories:

[listing,subs="attributes"]
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
----

### Install docker and start the docker daemon

In the next step you will:

. Update your system with any available software updates
. Install `docker` and a few additional rpms using `yum`
. Configure the `docker` daemon to start at boot time
. Start the `docker` daemon

If you don't have a root _Terminal_ window open, start a _Terminal_ window and become the root user with `su`.

Now download and install any available updates by running `yum update`.  If updates are available, `yum` will list them and ask if it is OK to proceed.

[listing,subs="attributes"]
----
$ su -
# yum update
----

Install `docker` and necessary additional rpms:

[listing,subs="attributes"]
----
# yum install docker device-mapper-libs device-mapper-event-libs
----

Enable the docker daemon to start at boot time and start it now:

[listing,subs="attributes"]
----
# systemctl enable docker.service
# systemctl start docker.service
----

Now verify that the docker daemon is running:

[listing,subs="attributes"]
----
# systemctl status docker.service
----

Your system is now ready to build and run docker-formatted containers. If you encounter difficulties at any point, see <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting and FAQ>>.
