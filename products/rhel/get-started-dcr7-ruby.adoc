## Step3 Content

In this step, you will create a tiny Hello World container that uses {tthw-langlong} as a web server. Once created, the container can be run on other systems that have `docker` installed.  You will need to create several files in an empty directory using your favorite editor, including a `Dockerfile` that describes the container. You don't need to be running under the root user to create the files, but you will need root privileges to run the `docker` commands.

First, create an empty directory, and then create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following contents, but change the `MAINTAINER` line to have your name and email address:

.Dockerfile
[listing,subs="attributes"]
----
FROM rhscl/{tthw-dciname}

MAINTAINER Your Name "your-email@example.com"

EXPOSE 8000

COPY . /opt/app-root/src

CMD /bin/bash -c 'ruby hello-http.rb'
----

Create the file `{tthw-hellofile}` with the following contents:

.hello-http.rb
[source,ruby]
----
require 'socket'

port = 8000
STDERR.print "Listening on port #{port}\n"

server = TCPServer.new('0.0.0.0', port)

loop do

  socket = server.accept
  request = socket.gets

  STDERR.puts request

  response = "Hello, Red Hat Developers World from Ruby" +
             RUBY_VERSION + "!\n"

  socket.print "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n" +
               "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n" +
               "Content-Length: " + response.bytesize.to_s + "\r\n" +
               "Connection: close\r\n"
  socket.print "\r\n"
  socket.print response

  socket.close
end
