:title: .NET Runtime for Red Hat Linux

== Overview

Microsoft’s .NET Framework has enjoyed 15 years of success and improvement on the Windows platform. With support for multiple languages as well as development models such as Model View Controller (MVC) and Object Relational Mapping (ORM), it has become the standard for Microsoft-centric application-development shops.

The delivery of .NET Core 1.0 brings that framework to Linux and Mac OS developers as well. By using this new framework, Linux developers can write C# code that will run on any platform, with performance rivaling or exceeding most other platforms.

Red Hat and Microsoft have partnered to make Red Hat available as a platform within Microsoft’s Azure cloud solution and to make the .NET environment on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) a First-Class experience.
