### API-driven Open Tooling

*Overview:*

The heart of the Red Hat Mobile Application Platform is an open technology stack, built API-first, that leverages the best of open source, to give you an environment that can be customised to your exact needs. You can easily tie our mobile application development flow into your existing toolchain. We call it Bring Your Own Tools (BYOT) with good reason.

Our web-based studio gets you up and running quickly, where you'll be installing a sample app on your device within minutes. This will familiarize you with the functionality in the platform so you can then start incorporating the capabilities of the platform into your own workflow and tools. And if you’re used to command line and Git you can use our FHC CLI and Git-based workflow to achieve all of the same results and more.

* Create Projects and Apps locally
* Debug/Test Client Apps and write Cloud Code locally
* Push and Pull code from GitHub or any Git repo into the platform
* Deploy your Node.js Cloud Code to your MBaaS
* Build your mobile app binaries in our build farm
* Work with re-usable mBaaS Services locally
* Use MongoDB locally or in the cloud
* Generate Forms and forms apps programmatically
* Interact with any of our APIs

*Products Included:*

You can achieve all of the above by simply having a Red Hat Mobile account and installing a small number of free local tools. This works on Linux, Windows and OSX:

* Node.js
* Git
* FHC CLI
* MongoDB

*Tips or other helpful related info:*

Our own engineers use a wide variety of tools to do mobile development. Whilst you'll probably use XCode, ADT/Android Studio or Visual Studio for Native App development, you can use everything from Emacs to Eclipse (Our own JBoss Developer Studio (JBDS) has Red Hat Mobile and Cordova integration) for hybrid app development and Node.js development. Those tools that come with Git support baked-in will make your life even easier. Most recently, our engineers have been using both Sublime Text 3 and Atom. The extended support for Red Hat Mobile in JBoss Developer Tools 9.0 will make it an obvious choice for existing JBDS users.

[[backend_integration]]
### Backend Integration

*Overview:*

Enterprise mobile applications are islands unless they are connected to something and islands are of limited use as enterprise apps go. This is where the MBaaS functionality in the Red Hat Mobile Application Platform comes in. By using our Node.js-based back-end which has staggering performance and responsiveness, developers can easily integrate with heterogeneous back-end systems, without having to build everything from scratch each time.

*How does the solution work:*

The Platform starts by giving you a range of mBaaS APIs that you can invoke from your native/hybrid mobile apps. These APIs provide functionality that includes:

* User Management
* Push Notifications
* Custom Cloud Calls
* Security
* NoSQL Data Store
* Data Caching
* Offline Sync
* Analytics
* Forms

However the phrase "Custom Cloud Calls" barely hints at the power available to you as a developer. You get full Node.js/Express to implement whatever you wish. You can make full use of the NPM ecosystem, including native modules. All of the API end-points you or anyone on your team create are then available to your mobile apps. Everything you are familiar with in Node is available.

On top of this we give you reusable MBaaS Services which you use to connect to your existing back-end systems. These are also Node.js/Express based but can be shared across one or more of your projects. They can be made internally discoverable using API Blueprint and they are a key enabler of an API-driven, micro-services approach to back-end development and integration.

Now you have a mobile-optimised back-end, making full use of the async performance of Node.js and possibly using both caching and NoSQL storage. Next you can leverage all of the power of JBoss Middleware, particularly JBoss Fuse to do advanced enterprise integrations by connecting your enterprise service bus to the MBaaS.

*Products Included:*

All of this functionality comes out of the box in the Red Hat Mobile Application platform. However, JBoss Fuse is a separate product suite.

Tips or other helpful related info:
Because everything we do in the back-end is standard Node.js + Express, you can upskill extremely quickly and take advantage of the huge community and extensive ecosystem around both. You don't need to learn proprietary languages or frameworks.

[[application_lifecycle_management]]
### Application Lifecycle Management

*Overview:*

Every developer knows that the life of a software project extends far beyond the initial coding phase. You need a range of tools and support that enable you to manage mobile apps and integrations from that code phase, through test, release and maintenance. The Red Hat Mobile Platform provides everything you need in a flexible non-prescriptive way to manage the entire lifecycle of your developments.

*How does the solution work:*

In the development and test phases of the project, you'll get:

* Dedicated development, test and pre-production environments
* A CLI that works with Travis, Jenkins for CD/CI
* Configuration management with full support for Git remotes, branching and tagging
* A cloud build farm to generate your mobile test binaries
* Cloud logging and events
* Team-based access controls to allow controlled collaboration

Once you are ready to deploy and release, you'll have:

* Application lifecycle management to promote client/cloud apps
* Separate production environment which you can manage seamlessly
* Build hybrid and native mobile/tablet apps in the cloud for iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8
* Mobile credential bundle management
* Build history and archive
* Build production mobile apps for public/private app stores
* Push binaries to MAM/MDM providers
* Full private enterprise app store for all supported mobile targets
* Reporting and Analytics to monitor app usage
* API stats to evaluate back-end performance and usage

*Products Included:*

Almost all of the above functionality comes out of the box in the Red Hat Mobile Application platform. However, extra environments come at an added cost.

*Tips or other helpful related info:*

Your ALM needs will change as your enterprise mobility maturity increases. By providing a suite of tools and functionality rather than a single prescriptive end-to-end solution, the Platform can evolve with you.

[[frontend_development]]
### Frontend Development

*Overview*

There are many equally valid approaches to mobile app development and as developers we’d rather make the choice of tools that work best for us. Rather than  forcing a case of one-size-fits-all, many  we believe that developers should be to free to bring their own tools. End-customer B2C App may have extremely high design and UX quality whereas a simple B2E project-specific app may choose a hybrid approach such as Apache Cordova to handle cross-platform app development in short timescales. The Red Hat Mobile Application Platform is equally comfortable with both native and hybrid approaches and is really focused on the idea of getting information to a variety of screens of any type.

*How does the solution work:*

Whether you are building native, hybrid or web apps, it is extremely easy to use our SDKs and tools to get the functionality you need.

* Support for Native iOS, Android and Windows Phone/Mobile
* Support for Hybrid Cordova Apps on iOS, Android and Windows Phone/Mobile
* Support for Appcelerator Titanium apps
* Support for cross-platform Xamarin .NET based apps
* Support for all leading Frameworks such as Angular, Ionic, Ember
* Import of existing apps into the platform
* Powerful offline sync framework so your apps work with bad or no connectivity
* Cross-platform push notifications
* Codeless forms apps built using Drag and Drop
* Forms APIs to easily add powerful forms functionality to your custom apps
* Hosted web apps with full access to the same APIs

*Products Included:*

All of the above functionality comes out of the box in the Red Hat Mobile Application platform. However, you may need separate licenses for third party tools/frameworks such as Xamarin.

*Tips or other helpful related info:*

We are strong supporters of the idea of building Offline-First. Your apps should be able to deliver value to your clients irrespective of the connectivity they have at a particular moment.

[[cloud_and_on-premise_deployment]]
### Cloud and On-Premise Deployment

*Overview*

A mobile platform that only works on one Cloud provider or needs many months to deploy On-Premise isn't much use to you when your project started yesterday. The Red Hat Mobile Platform can be easily deployed in many different ways to exactly suit your needs now and in the future, as they change.


*How does the solution work:*

* Many of our customers start with our Multi-Tenant SaaS offering on a Public Cloud such as AWS. This gets you up and running almost immediately with no effort on your part. You can choose exactly the Environment and mBaaS configuration you need and our Operations team ensures you never have to worry about any aspect of it. In addition, you get all the latest and greatest features before everyone else.

* Others choose a completely dedicated installation in a Public or Private Cloud where their own Operations people manage the platform which runs on OpenShift Enterprise 3.x and RHEL

* Finally, customers needing an On-Premise installation are fully catered for with the entire Mobile Platform running on OpenShift Enterprise 3.x and RHEL in your own infrastructure with all the tools you need to manage and maintain it.

In every case, secure integration to your back-end systems via VPN or IP whitelisting can easily be setup.

*Products Included:*

The Multi-Tenant SaaS offering is based on our Standard subscription model. Pricing and features for dedicated installations and On-Premise are TBD.

*Tips or other helpful related info:*

A model for our customers is to start with a simple non-custom Multi-Tenant SaaS setup so they can start development today. Meanwhile, planning around a dedicated mBaaS, a dedicated full installation or an On-Premise installation can happen in parallel and migration can occur at a later point.
