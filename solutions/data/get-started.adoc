## Caching

More often than not, you need to tweak your application or infrastructure to make some usage faster. This is not a new subject but letâs explore some interesting advantages available to you when using Red Hatâs portfolio.

### Options

#### _I use Hibernate ORM and my database access is slower than I need._

* discovering your Hibernate ORM link:#[performance knobs and levers]
* understanding link:#[first level caching (Session)]
* using link:#[second level caching] with link:#[JBoss DataGrid]
  * entity caching
  * collection caching
  * query caching
* understanding Hibernate link:#[statistics]

#### _Some operations are slow and need to be cached_

* link:#[cluster caches] with JBoss Data Grid
  * link:#[storing] intermediary or already massaged data
  * link:#[querying] massaged data
* Use link:#[CDI extension] to cache method return values based on a policy

## Search and UX

How can Red Hat help me with my Search and UX problems?

When was the last time you used an application without a search box? People are used to Google, not only its relevancy but also its speed. It has morphed our UI and UX to offer less static navigation trees and more search box based UIs. This has become critically important for mobile applications where the screen space is of the essence.

link:#[Hibernate Search] sits in the middle and offers a few benefits:

* it uses Lucene underneath
* it transparently indexes all the database changes you make through Hibernate ORM and does it in the most efficient manner
* it letâs you define how to index and how to query your domain model
* link:#[get started] with Hibernate Search

On the operational side, Hibernate Search offer indexing clustering through a variety of techniques:

* master / slaves with JMS / JGroups replication
* store the indexes in a file system regularly copied
* or store the indexes in JBoss Data Grid so that changes are instantaneously visible.

TODO:

* Describe the various full-text queries and give links
* Mention geospatial queries
* Mention faceting (Amazonâs way to drill down on query results by authors, categories, rating etc
* Mention Hibernate Search is part of JBoss EAP

## Data Storage and access to multiple data stores

We are living more and more in a world where the data is spread across multiple system. How do I develop for that?

### Get started

#### _I need to access a NoSQL store._

Access NoSQL datastores using the JPA APIs very much like you access your relational database via link:#[Hibernate OGM].
Supported datastores:

* link:#[MongoDB] (document store)
* link:#[Neo4J] (graph)
* link:#[Infinispan] (key/value)
* link:#[Ehcache] (key/value)
* link:#[CouchDB] (in progress)
* link:#[Cassandra] (in progress)

#### _I need to federate several datastores into making it look like one._

* link:/products/datavirt[JBoss Data Virtualization] allows you to define a logical schema that will tap into several physical and disparate datastores:
  * integrate link:#[relational databases],
  * integrate link:#[NoSQL datastores],
  * integrate link:#[file systems],
  * integrate link:#[Salesforce],
  * integrate link:#[SAP],
  * link:#[list all connectors]

#### _Integrate, automate and massage your data flow needed by your applications_

* link:#[Get started] automating the delivery of data link:/products/fuse[JBoss Fuse]
* link:#[Scale] beyond the limits of your NoSQL datasource

#### _NoSQL_

* link:#[Get started] with link:#[Red Hat Software Collection's] version of link:#[MongoDB]
* link:#[Get started with JBoss Data Grid]
* TODO:  Get supported partners, get links to running NoSQL on O.S.O.

## Data Streaming

#### _Data streaming, batch analytics and stream-oriented data analytics_

* link:#[Get the most out of Hadoop and SPark with a data grid ]
