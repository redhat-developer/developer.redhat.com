Your web applications are not just Java - at a minimum they also have HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  And for some ideas, Ruby, Python, or Node may be a better approach.  How do you allow the right tool for the right problem while still maintaining application and environment integrity along with an environment that is supportable?

Taking that polyglot to the next step, how do you create, orchestrate, and publish an API that is language agnostic so your product community can build on the great work you did?

Keep reading to get some ideas on how Red Hat Web & API products can help with these challenges and more.
