Your web applications are not just Java - at a minimum they also have HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  And for some ideas, Ruby, Python, or Node may be a better approach.  How do you allow the right tool for the right problem while still maintaining application and environment integrity along with an environment that is supportable?

Taking that polyglot to the next step, how do you create, orchestrate, and publish an API that is language agnostic so your product community can build on the great work you did?

Keep reading to get some ideas on how Red Hat Web & API products can help with these challenges and more.

### [[api]]Integration and API
Products that grow communities flourish.  Whether you are providing access to your maps for people to build upon, your government data for people to openly look for patterns across, or your inventory data to create an online marketplace - and everywhere in between - it is no denying that we are living in an Open API world.

Whether you are publishing services or consuming someone else's APIs integration can be tricky.  Take a look at using link:/products/fuse[Fuse], link:/products/amq[A-MQ] and link:/products/datavirt[Data Virtualization] to make the job that much easier.

#### Creating APIs via REST
Representational State Transfer (REST) works well with a API-centric web applications. RESTEasy makes it simple to expose your services via JAX-RS.

| Using Angular and RESTFul services link:/web-and-api-development/learn/#!sys_type=quickstart&query=Angular[Get Started]

##### Orchestrating APIs via Fuse
Fuse is a small footprint enterprise service bus (ESB) that lets you build, deploy and integrate applications and services.

##### Simple Services with Difficult Data
Have data that you want to expose as a service?  What if it is from a file, or from multiple systems?  JBoss Data Virtualization makes it simple to create secure API access to your data, whether it is one source or many.

|=====

##### A-MQ
Message buses are as important to integration and API development as service endpoints.  Leverage message buses to transport data in a consistent manner, handle potential disconnects, and distribute work.

A-MQ gives you a high performance, cross-platform multi-language messaging system that can be deployed across your infrastructure.
