The web is a dynamic, open environment.  Daily we see new ideas and creations, built upon a collection of data sets, services, and APIs.  Enterprises are looking to build and extend their product community through the use of web applications and APIs.

Whether you have a simple website, are building a new web application, extending an existing one, or creating a new API to extend your product community, Red Hat has solutions to assist you.

With Red Hat it is easy to build and manage products in your choice of modern languages ranging from Java to Ruby up through Python and Node all without the effort and risk associated with installing and troubleshooting unsupported community versions.

The web isn't just one language or technology - why should your development be limited to one?

With Red Hat, you will find tools to help you build your applications easily - from link:http://www.jboss.org/products/devstudio/overview/[Developer IDEs] to link:https://www.openshift.com/products/technologies[Languages and Platforms] and link:http://www.jboss.org/products/fuse/overview/[API Tools]
